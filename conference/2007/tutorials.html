		<span class="bodyTextTitle">How to Build and Maintain Useful Ontologies</span> 
		(<a href="http://ontology.buffalo.edu/smith" target="_blank">Barry Smith</a>)<br /><br />
		This tutorial will provide an overview of what we have learned from recent work, especially in the 
		biomedical domain, regarding practices of ontology building. We will focus not on tools and 
		implementations, but rather on the steps needed to create coherent ontology content. Topics to be 
		dealt with will include:<br /><br />

		<ol>
			<li style="padding-bottom:3px;">Basics of ontology building -- How to formulate terms, definitions, axioms.</li>
			<li style="padding-bottom:3px;">Some ontology success stories -- The role of annotations; how to make ontologies work successfully 
			with instance-data in real-world contexts.</li>
			<li style="padding-bottom:3px;">Ontology cooperation -- How to resolve problems where ontologies overlap.</li>
			<li style="padding-bottom:3px;">Ontology terminology -- How the different disciplinary groups in ontology development and application can 
			communicate with each other when they use different terminologies?</li>
			<li style="padding-bottom:3px;">Ontology evolution -- How to improve ontologies, and how to keep track of improvements in useful ways.</li>
			<li style="padding-bottom:3px;">Ontology evaluation -- How can we prove that high-quality ontologies bring real benefits? What are 
			examples of successful use cases.</li>

		<span class="bodyTextTitle">OWL Tutorial</span>
		(Alan Rector, Olivier Dameron, Nick Drummond, Matthew Horridge)<br /><br />
		OWL is the W3C standard ontology language for the Semantic Web, and Prot&eacute;g&eacute;-OWL the most widely used 
		editing tool for OWL.  This three-part tutorial introduces OWL ontology development with Prot&eacute;g&eacute;-OWL, 
		presents the majors features of the OWL-DL languages, and explains how to leverage these features for performing 
		advanced reasoning tasks.  This will be a &quot;hands-on&quot; adaptation and extension of the famous 
		Prot&eacute;g&eacute;-OWL 
		<a href="http://www.co-ode.org/resources/tutorials/ProtegeOWLTutorial.pdf" target="_blank">pizza tutorial</a>.  The three 
		parts are in continuity, but intermediate resources will be provided so that participants can attend only the second, 
		the third, or the second and third parts depending on their level of expertise.<br /><br />
		
		The first part of the tutorial covers the basic language elements of OWL (classes, properties, and individuals) and shows 
		how they can be edited with Prot&eacute;g&eacute;-OWL. The goal of this session is to demonstrate how to create the various 
		elements of a pizza ontology and how to structure this ontology.  The intended audience is users not familiar with the 
		Prot&eacute;g&eacute;-OWL editor or with the OWL language.<br /><br />
		
		The second part of the tutorial introduces the semantics of the OWL language constructs. We will explore more complex 
		OWL class descriptions by showing how different types of restrictions can be used to enhance the logical meaning of 
		classes, after which we will discuss the important notion of primitive and defined classes.  The goal of this session is 
		to demonstrate how to use the richness of the OWL language both for providing an accurate description of a domain knowledge 
		and for using this knowledge in order to make the development and maintenance of the ontology easier and safer.  The 
		intended audience comprises those who attended the first part and those who want to have an introduction to the semantics 
		of the OWL language.<br /><br />
		
		The third part of the tutorial introduces a more advanced exploitation of the reasoning power of OWL. We will cover the 
		open world assumption and compare class and instance-based reasoning.  The intended audience comprises those who attended 
		the second part and those who want to get an in-depth understanding of the capabilities of OWL reasoning.

		<li>
		<span class="bodyTextTitle">SWRLTab Tutorial</span> (Martin O'Connor)<br /><br />
		This tutorial will provide an in depth look at the 
		<a href="http://protege.cim3.net/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?SWRLTab" target="_blank">SWRLTab</a>, a development environment 
		for working with Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) rules in Prot&eacute;g&eacute;-OWL. The tutorial will provide an 
		introduction to the SWRL language. Hands-on sessions will cover the authoring of rules using the SWRL Editor and 
		the execution of rules using the SWRLJessTab. The set of libraries provided by the SWRLTab will also be covered. 
		These libraries can be used in SWRL rules and include collections of mathematical, string, and temporal operators, 
		in addition to operators that can be used to effectively turn SWRL into a query language.<br /><br />
		
		The target audience member is an existing Prot&eacute;g&eacute;-OWL user. Attendance at the OWL Tutorial or 
		previous familiarity with basic OWL concepts are minimal requirements.<br /><br />

		<a name="visualization"></a>
		<li>
		<span class="bodyTextTitle">Ontology Visualization</span> (Jennifer Vendetti)<br /><br />
		
		This tutorial will focus on several Prot&eacute;g&eacute; plug-ins that have been developed specifically 
		for the purpose of visualizing ontologies. The first portion of the tutorial will be a hands-on walk-through 
		of the graph widget tutorial that is available on the Prot&eacute;g&eacute; Web site. The graph widget is a 
		custom slot widget plug-in that allows users to graphically create and populate instances of classes. 
		It is very useful as a) an alternative to Prot&eacute;g&eacute; Forms for entering instance data, 
		b) as a way to visualize networks of instances, and c) as a way to visualize relationships between instances.  The 
		graph widget can be used both in the 
		<a href="http://protege.stanford.edu/overview/protege-frames.html" target="_blank">Prot&eacute;g&eacute;-Frames</a> and 
		<a href="http://protege.stanford.edu/overview/protege-owl.html" target="_blank">Prot&eacute;g&eacute;-OWL</a> 
		editing environments.<br /><br />
		
		The second portion of the tutorial will be a demonstration of the 
		<a href="http://protege.cim3.net/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?OntoViz" target="_blank">OntoViz</a>, 
		<a href="http://www.co-ode.org/downloads/owlviz/co-ode-index.php" target="_blank">OWLViz</a>, 
		<a href="http://www.thechiselgroup.org/~chisel/projects/jambalaya/jambalaya.html" target="_blank">Jambalaya</a>, and 
		<a href="http://users.ecs.soton.ac.uk/~ha/TGVizTab/TGVizTab.htm" target="_blank">TGVizTab</a> tab plug-ins. 
		If time permits at the end of the tutorial, there will also be a demonstration of a new visualization plug-in called the 
		<a href="http://protege.cim3.net/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?ImpactAlignmentTab" target="_blank">Impact & Alignment Tab</a>, which is a 
		work in progress and will be released (hopefully) in the fall. The target audience for this tutorial are Prot&eacute;g&eacute; 
		users with little exposure to the existing visualization plug-ins that are currently available. If users plan to follow the 
		hands-on portion of the tutorial, basic experience with navigating the Prot&eacute;g&eacute; user interface will be assumed. 
		Attendees should know how to perform rudimentary tasks such as opening projects and creating new classes, slots, and 
		instances.<br /><br />

		<span class="bodyTextTitle">JessTab &amp; JessAgentTab Tutorial</span> (Henrik Eriksson, Karl-Heinz Krempels)<br /><br />
	    The first 2.5 hours of this tutorial will introduce the <a href="http://www.ida.liu.se/~her/JessTab/" target="_blank">JessTab extension</a>, 
	    which enables the use of the <a href="http://herzberg.ca.sandia.gov/jess/" target="_blank">Java Expert System Shell (Jess)</a> 
	    under Prot&eacute;g&eacute;. The tutorial will cover basic Jess programming, rule-based reasoning with Jess under 
	    Prot&eacute;g&eacute;, and the use of Jess for managing Prot&eacute;g&eacute; ontologies and knowledge bases. 
	    Furthermore, the tutorial will address the mapping of instances in Prot&eacute;g&eacute; knowledge bases to Jess facts 
	    and use of the JessTab with both <a href="../../overview/protege-frames.html">Prot&eacute;g&eacute;-Frames</a> and 
	    <a href="../../overview/protege-owl.html">Prot&eacute;g&eacute;-OWL</a>. The tutorial will 
	    exemplify practical uses of Jess together with Prot&eacute;g&eacute; and discuss common design patterns. The tutorial 
	    will demonstrate how to install Jess and the JessTab and how to interact with the JessTab. The target audience is 
	    developers interested in combining ontologies and reasoning. No prior knowledge of Jess or the JessTab is required.
		<br /><br />
		
		The last 30 minutes of this tutorial will present the JessAgentTab and is focused on a four stage development 
		process of agent-based applications. In this process, Prot&eacute;g&eacute;'s main role is the knowledge 
		representation integration among the different tools used in each stage, but also ontology modeling, knowledge 
		acquisition, problem solving method development, and code generation and export to the target technology 
		(agent technology, Web services, etc.). The first stage covers domain analysis and requirements specification 
		with the help of well-established tools in the domain of discourse. The second stage addresses knowledge engineering: 
		ontology modeling and knowledge acquisition with the help of core Prot&eacute;g&eacute; functionality. The problem 
		solving method (PSM) is developed/implemented with the help of the JessTab (Henrik Eriksson) in stage three. 
		The last stage covers code generation and export of the ontology (TBox, ABox) and PSM into a JessAgent. 
		The JessAgent is a generic rule-based agent with FIPA (Foundation of Intelligent and Physical Agents) interaction 
		capabilities and an embedded Jess (Java Expert System Shell) rule engine for reasoning. The target audience is 
		developers interested in combining ontologies, reasoning, and agent-based application development. No prior knowledge 
		of Jess, JessAgent, the JessTab, or the JessAgentTab is required.<br /><br />

		<li>
	    <span class="bodyTextTitle">Application Development with Prot&eacute;g&eacute;</span> (Timothy Redmond)<br /><br />
	    This tutorial will address the issue of developing plug-ins and applications with Prot&eacute;g&eacute;. It will 
		start with a description of the Prot&eacute;g&eacute; Plug-in Framework and describe how the plug-in framework can 
		be used to add capabilities to the Prot&eacute;g&eacute; system. We will cover all of the 
		<a href="../../doc/pdk/plugins/overview.html">existing plug-in types</a>. We will describe what is necessary to 
		develop each type of plug-in and how each plug-in type extends the Prot&eacute;g&eacute; application.  We will 
		follow-up the discussion of Prot&eacute;g&eacute; plug-ins with a discussion of an alternative paradigm of development 
		in Prot&eacute;g&eacute;: the development of standalone Prot&eacute;g&eacute; applications. We will see that in many 
		cases, there is a natural evolution from the development of Prot&eacute;g&eacute; plug-ins to the development of 
		standalone Prot&eacute;g&eacute; applications. We will describe the architectural design issues in application 
		development and analyze some real deployed applications that have been built with Prot&eacute;g&eacute;. The target 
		audience includes both Java programmers and non-programmers.
