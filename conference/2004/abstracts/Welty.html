    <td><blockquote>The human practice of ontology engineering, in particular 
        maintenance, can be significantly improved with help from a variety of 
        sources. In this community, the impact of tools such as Protege may be 
        obvious, but it has been also been demonstrated that a rigorous theory 
        of ontology development, such as OntoClean, can improve performance of 
        Ontology-based systems, and that text analysis can help improve the development 
        speed and accuracy of ontology maintenance. &Ecirc;We have been working 
        on combining the &quot;three ts&quot; -- texts, tools, and theories -- 
        into a Protege-based environment for ontology maintenance supported by 
        text analysis and the OntoClean methodology. In this talk, I will give 
        a brief overview of the technologies we are combining and show some examples 
        of how the ontology maintenance process can be improved.</blockquote></td>
