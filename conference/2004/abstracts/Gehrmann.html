    <td><p>We are presenting a method to use protege as an effective tool for 
        auditing management systems. Auditing has the objective to determine systematically 
        the extent to which management system requirements are fulfilled and to 
        provide a documentation of the audit finding. Therefore a prerequisite 
        of effective auditing is an effective knowledge aquisition process and 
        the capability to represent complex audit findings. An auditing process 
        of complex organizations requires effective management of concepts from 
        various technical and organizational domains. Further it requires effective 
        communication in an audit team and the capability to identify conceptual 
        inconsistencies and to agree about audit findings. Protege and various 
        plug-ins can be used to create domain knowledge during an audit process 
        and to vizualize organizational structures and processes.<br>
        <br>
        The objective of the presentation is to propose an ontology based auditing 
        method by using a protege ontology.<br>
        <br>
        Our methodology utilizes preinstalled ontologies represented in protege 
        and offers a mechanism to use this stored knowledge in an audit process.The 
        pre-installed knowledge base is a result of extended experience in the 
        field of quality information management. We consider this approach as 
        an opportunity to extend the application area of protege to the auditing 
        field. <br>
