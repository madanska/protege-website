Auditing has the objective to determine? systematically the extent to which management system requirements are fulfilled and to provide a documentation of the audit finding.Therefor a prerequisite of effective auditing is an effective knowledge aquisition process and the capability to represent complex audit findings.An auditing process of complex organizations requires effective management of concepts from various technical and organizational domains. Further it requires effective communication in an audit team and the capability to identify conceptual inconsistencies and to agree about audit findings. Protege and various plug-ins can be used to create domain knowledge during an audit process and to vizualize organizational structures and processes.Objectives of the presentation is to propose an ontology based auditing method? by using a protege ontology? Our methodology utilize preinstalled ontologies represented in protege and offers a mechanism to use this stored knowledge in an audit process.The pre- installed knowledge base is a result of extented experience in the field of quality information management. We consider this approach as an opportunity to extent the application area of protege to the auditing field.
