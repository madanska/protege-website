    <td>This presentation will report on some highlights of the use of Prot&eacute;g&eacute; 
        to construct a domain model in the human resources (HR) area, specifically 
        managerial compensation planning. This domain involves specifying a complex 
        set of relationships between types of compensation programs employed at 
        large organizations (e.g. base pay increases, bonus, stock awards, other 
        non-cash benefits), corporate budget allocations and transfers, multiple 
        organizational hierarchies used for compensation eligibility and award 
        approval, and decision support concepts (e.g. budget modeling, guidelines 
        and limits).<br>
        <br>
        At Workscape, a major provider of HR software solutions, we have been 
        evolving this domain model over the last several months and leveraging 
        it in the construction of a next-generation product to support complex 
        compensation planning problems. Early results have been encouraging, and 
        project is ongoing.<br>
        <br>
        Some of the salient topics to be covered in this presentation are as follows:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>- The process of cultivating acceptance of a domain modeling tool as 
          a supplement to an object-oriented modeling tool<br>
          in a software product company;
          <br>
          - Embedding the use of Prot&eacute;g&eacute; within a software product 
          development process;
          <br>
          - Custom Prot&eacute;g&eacute; Metaclasses useful for supporting software 
          product development;
          <br>
          - Experience with exporting Prot&eacute;g&eacute; models to Rational 
          Rose;
          <br>
          - Use of advanced Prot&eacute;g&eacute; widgets in the domain modeling 
          process, e.g., 
        <blockquote>
                     Graph Widget for modeling organizational hierarchies<br>
            Table Widget for UI prototyping;</p>
        </blockquote>
       
          - Use of Prot&eacute;g&eacute; forms as mockups for product usability 
          testing;
          <br>
          - Metrics on the domain model;
          <br>
          - Role of Prot&eacute;g&eacute; in developing business services;
          <br>
          - Suggested extensions to the tool that would be particularly useful 
          for software product development<br></p>
          </p> </p>
