    <td>Understanding the logical meaning of any description logic or similar 
      formalism is difficult for most people, and OWL-DL is no exception. This 
      paper presents the most common difficulties encountered by newcomers to 
      the language, that have been observed during the course of more than a dozen 
      workshops, tutorials and modules about OWL-DL and it&Otilde;s predecessor 
      languages. It emphasizes understanding the exactly meaning of OWL expressions 
      &ETH; proving that understanding by paraphrasing them in pedantic but explicit 
      language. It addresses, specifically, the confusion which OWL&Otilde;s open 
      world assumption presents to users accustomed to closed world systems such 
      as databases, logic programming and frame languages. The experience has 
      had a major influence in formulating the requirements for a new set of interfaces 
      for OWL the first of which are now available as prototypes. A summary of 
      the guidelines and paraphrases and examples of the new interface are provided. 
      The example ontologies are available online.<br>
