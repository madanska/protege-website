<strong>Prot&eacute;g&eacute; plug-in library : A task-oriented tour</strong><br>
Instructors: Samson Tu, Jennifer Vendetti, Natasha Noy<br><br>

Prot&eacute;g&eacute; was developed with a plug-in architecture to allow users to extend Prot&eacute;g&eacute;’s 
core functionalities. Over the years, developers at Stanford and elsewhere have contributed to a growing library 
of plug-ins. This tutorial will look how various Prot&eacute;g&eacute; plug-ins can be used to perform tasks involved 
in the life cycle of developing and maintaining Prot&eacute;g&eacute; ontologies, knowledge bases, and applications. 
We will first review the different types of Prot&eacute;g&eacute; plug-ins, then discuss and demonstrate options 
available for various tasks in the ontology life-cycle:

<ul>
<li>Import and merging of knowledge sources</li>
<li>Visualization of a Prot&eacute;g&eacute; knowledge base</li>
<li>Integrity checking</li>
<li>Navigation and searching</li>
<li>Version management</li>
<li>Export and publishing</li>
<li>Application development</li>
</ul>

The tutorial assumes some basic familiarity with Prot&eacute;g&eacute;. Alternatively, the morning tutorial on Ontology Development 
should provide sufficient background to attend this tutorial. This tutorial is designed to help beginning and intermediate 
users of Prot&eacute;g&eacute; exploit available tools to get their work done.<br><br>

Note that this tutorial will not cover OWL-related plug-ins. Attendees interested in the OWL support are encouraged to 
go to the OWL tutorial.
