<span class="bodyTextBold">Call for Tutorial Proposals</span><br><br>

The Seventh International Prot&eacute;g&eacute; Conference will be held on July 6-9, 2004. The 
meeting will take place at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland. This meeting 
is traditionally a forum for users to meet one another and the Protege team and for us to meet you. 
We discuss common problems and solutions as well as current activities and plans. The meetings 
are fairly informal and also help the Prot&eacute;g&eacute; team to set priorities for development 
work. This will be the first meeting to take place in North America in over 8 years, following a 
long series of very successful meetings in Europe.<br><br>

We invite proposals for tutorials, to be held on the first day of the conference, July 6, 2004. Tutorials 
can be 90 minutes or 180 minutes in length.<br><br>

Please note that due to a limited number of rooms at the conference venue, we will only be able to 
accept a very small number of tutorials.  We encourage submitters to contact us before the deadline 
if there is any concern about overlap with other similar tutorial topics.<br><br>
