<strong>OWL Tutorial</strong><br>
Holger Knublauch, Stanford University<br><br>

The Web Ontology Language (OWL) has been accepted as the standard for the representation of sharable domain 
models. The vision of the Semantic Web is to integrate these ontologies so that autonomous agents can provide 
intelligent services.<br><br>

This tutorial will serve as an introduction to OWL and Prot&eacute;g&eacute;'s support for OWL and the Semantic 
Web in general.<br><br>

We will cover the following issues:
<ul>
	<li>OWL and the Semantic Web</li>
	<li>Prot&eacute;g&eacute; and the OWL Plugin</li>
	<li>How to define OWL classes and properties</li>
	<li>How to use description logics features of OWL (e.g., classification)</li>
	<li>How to create individuals for Semantic Web contents</li>
	<li>How to customize and extend the OWL Plugin</li>
</ul>

The tutorial will be hands-on and provide sufficient time for questions on all aspects of OWL and the 
Prot&eacute;g&eacute; OWL Plugin. Attendees should have Prot&eacute;g&eacute; and the OWL Plugin installed if 
possible, but we will also pass around installation CDs.<br><br>

No prior knowledge of OWL or Prot&eacute;g&eacute; is required, although reading the Prot&eacute;g&eacute;/OWL 
tutorial in advance will certainly help following the tutorial. You should bring your laptop if you want to follow 
the walk-though.<br><br>
