<strong>Plug-in Development</strong><br>
Ray Fergerson, Stanford University<br><br>

This tutorial will focus on various ways that Prot&eacute;g&eacute; can be extended. We will cover traditional 
plug-ins, new plug-ins that became available in release 2.1, and other powerful extension mechanisms.<br><br>

The tutorial will be aimed primarily at Java programmers who wish to extend Prot&eacute;g&eacute; and want to know 
both what can be done and how to do it. This tutorial will also be of interest to others who merely wish to learn 
what can be done with the system but who may not be primarily interested in implementation issues. There will be 
little emphasis on the actual writing of code and more on conceptual issues, capabilities, and packaging. No previous 
experience developing Prot&eacute;g&eacute; extensions is assumed.<br><br><br>
