Call for Participation<br><br>
<strong>Workshop on Using Prot&eacute;g&eacute; in Medical Applications</strong><br><br>
Tuesday July 6th, 2004<br>
Bethesda, Maryland<br><br>

<em>In conjunction with the Seventh International Prot&eacute;g&eacute; Conference</em><br><br>

Prot&eacute;g&eacute; was originally developed as a metatool for creating knowledge-acquisition tools in medicine. 
Since then, its use in medical applications has extended far beyond its original purpose. At the University Of 
Newcastle Upon Tyne Newcastle England, for example, we have been using Prot&eacute;g&eacute; for our decision support 
development, and had to wrestle with Prot&eacute;g&eacute; in terms of both its knowledge modeling capabilities and 
its role in the life cycle of an application.<br><br>

This workshop brings together researchers and practitioners with an interest in using Prot&eacute;g&eacute; in medical 
applications. Topics include, but are not limited to:

<ul>
	<li>Guideline Ontology Development</li>
	<li>Creation and Use of Medical terminologies</li>
	<li>Representation of medical knowledge sources such as Drug Ontology</li>
	<li>Large scale knowledge base development using Multiple Authors</li>
	<li>Decision support, information retrieval, and other innovative applications</li>
	<li>QA, validation and testing</li>
	<li>Text documentation of Protégé ontologies</li>
	<li>The possible uses of OWL in future medical applications</li>
</ul>

The workshop format is a series of presentations or demonstrations followed by a general discussion. If you wish to make a 
presentation at the workshop, you should submit a two-page abstract to <a href="mailto:n.k.jones@ncl.ac.uk">Neill Jones</a> 
by e-mail no later than June 1, 2004. If you would like to attend (without giving a presentation), it is sufficient to submit 
a brief statement of interest to the organizer by e-mail no later than June 1, 2004.<br><br>
