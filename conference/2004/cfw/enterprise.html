<strong>Extending Enterprise Ontologies: Levels, Limits, and Tensions</strong><br><br><br>

<strong>Rationale</strong>
<ul>
<li>
The Ontolog Forum is an open, platform-neutral community, focused on issues associated with the engineering of business ontologies
</li>
<li>
One of its main projects has been to develop a formal ontology based on the UBL schemas
</li>
<li>
The community has used Protege in a number of ways. Some were successful. Some were not.
</li>
</ul>

<strong>Who should attend?</strong>
<ul>
<li>
This workshop will report lessons learned, describe future projects, and other topics of general interest to the Protege community in general, as well as those interested in Ontological Engineering and eBusiness projects. This especially addresses those with expertise in the converstion of Protégé-based ontologies to OWL, RDF/S, XML/XSD, UML2, and related projects.
</li>
<li>
Those with an interest in contributing to these general discussions of are encourage to attend and submit 
additional papers for consideration to <a href="mailto:robsmith5@1talltrees.com">Bob Smith</a> or 
<a href="mailto:conrad@SageBrushGroup.com">Kurt Conrad</a> on or before June 1st, 2004.
