Call for Participation<br><br>
<strong>Workshop on Visualization in Knowledge Engineering (VIKE)</strong><br><br>
Tuesday July 6th, 2004<br>
Bethesda, Maryland<br><br>

<em>In conjunction with the Seventh International Prot&eacute;g&eacute; Conference</em><br><br>

Knowledge engineering is often a complex area for end-user and engineer alike.  This workshop 
explores cognitive issues in both knowledge engineering processes and tools. In the past few 
years, many tools have been developed to support people working with formal, complex knowledge 
models.  These tools can be advanced visual interfaces like visualization tabs, or instance creation 
wizards, or simpler slot widgets that provide support in a specific area. Some of these tools 
include <a href="../../../plugins/ontoviz/ontoviz.html">Ontoviz</a>, 
<a href="http://shrimp.cs.uvic.ca/downloads_jambalaya_clear.htm">Jambalaya</a>, 
<a href="http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/~ha/TGVizTab/TGVizTab.htm">TGVizTab</a>, 
<a href="http://iweb.etri.re.kr/ezowl/index.html">EZ-Owl</a>, the 
<a href="../../../plugins/instancetree/index.html">Instance Tree widget</a>, and the 
<a href="http://www.kmc.nkfust.edu.tw/protege/calendarwidget/">Calendar</a> widget.<br><br>

Building on a <a href="http://www.cs.uvic.ca/~nernst/vike/vike2003.html" target="_blank">successful session</a> 
at KCAP 2003, VIKE 2004 brings together researchers and developers of 
these tools with practitioners who have an interest in various aspects of cognitive support and problem 
solving in the Prot&eacute;g&eacute; environment, as well as other knowledge engineering environments. 
Topics include, but are not limited to:

<ul>
	<li>Visual support for knowledge engineering processes</li> 
	<li>Visual query creation</li>
	<li>Knowledge discovery through interactive exploration</li>
	<li>Information Visualization and the Semantic Web</li>
	<li>Scalability of visual representations of complex data</li>
</ul>

This is a half-day workshop approximately 3.5 hours in duration. The workshop format is a series of presentations 
followed by a general discussion. Presentations may be about particular visualization or user-support tools, or 
(equally important) problems and suggestions for future work. We are also considering tool demonstrations and 
how-tos with a common ontology.<br><br>

We are particularly interested in comments and presentations from end-users. If you wish to make a presentation 
at the workshop, you should submit a two-page summary to <a href="mailto:nernst@cs.uvic.ca">Neil Ernst</a> by e-mail no later than June 1, 2004.  More 
details will be posted at <a href="http://www.cs.uvic.ca/~nernst/vike" target="_blank">http://www.cs.uvic.ca/~nernst/vike</a>.<br><br>
