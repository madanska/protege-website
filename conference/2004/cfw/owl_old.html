<strong>Prot&eacute;g&eacute; OWL Workshop on Semantic Web and Description Logics</strong><br><br>

<strong>Rationale</strong><br><br>

Semantic Web technologies such as OWL and its foundation on 
Description Logics
   form a rapidly evolving field concerning not only the development 
and maintenance
   of ontologies (OWL, Prompt, CO-ODE), but also their application (reasoning,
   rule languages, ...). Prot&eacute;g&eacute; with the OWL Plugin has 
become one
   of the key tools in this area, and will help explore the potential 
and applicability
   of Semantic Web technology in real world projects.<br><br>

<strong>Description</strong><br><br>
This workshop aims to:
     <ul>

   <li>presenting the latest developments in this area;</li>
       <li>identifying the future needs;</li>
       <li>discussing to what extend they can be integrated in the 
Prot&eacute;g&eacute; environment.</li>
     </ul>

The workshop will consists of presentations and demos of the 
latest developments
   and the identification of future needs. Presentations are expected 
to last between
   15 and 20 minutes. An open discussion in the end of the workshop will leave
   room for identifying future directions.<br><br>


<strong>Topics</strong><br><br>
We invite presentations for the following topics (non 
restrictive list):
     <ul>

   <li>Relation of Description Logics with other formalisms such as frames</li>
       <li>Extensions of OWL (metaclasses, rules...)</li>

   <li>Best modeling practices and design patterns</li>
       <li>Tools for editing and maintaining OWL ontologies</li>
       <li>Reasoning (classification, rules...)</li>
       <li>Semantic Web applications and Prot&eacute;g&eacute;</li>
     </ul>


<b>Notice:</b> Due to space restrictions, we may need to limit the number of
   workshop attendees. Interested participants are invited to send us 
a statement
   of interest. If you want to give a presentation on one of the above topics,
   you should submit an extended abstract (around one or two pages), which will
   be published on the Workshop web site. Statement of interest for attendance
   and presentation submission should arrive <font color="#ff0000"> 
before <strong>May
   15th</strong></font> and should be sent to <a

   Knublauch</a>.<br><br>

<strong>Intended public</strong><br><br>

This workshops is primarily directed to people already involved in 
OWL related
   projects, be it for tools or applications. Newcomers may rather 
want to attend
   the OWL tutorial session.<br><br>
