<span class="bodyTextBold">Call For Workshop Proposals</span><br><br>

The Seventh International Prot&eacute;g&eacute; Conference will be held on July 6-9, 2004. The 
meeting will take place at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland. This meeting 
is traditionally a forum for users to meet one another and the Protege team and for us to meet you. 
We discuss common problems and solutions as well as current activities and plans. The meetings 
are fairly informal and also help the Prot&eacute;g&eacute; team to set priorities for development 
work. This will be the first meeting to take place in North America in over 8 years, following a 
long series of very successful meetings in Europe.<br><br>

We invite proposals for workshops, to be held on the first day of the conference, July 6, 2004. All 
workshops will be half-day events. The purpose of the workshops is to provide an informal setting 
for participants to discuss technical issues and to exchange research ideas. We expect that most of 
the workshops will be interactive events, centering on discussions rather than presentations.<br><br>

We strongly advise having more than one organizer, bringing different perspectives to the workshop topic. 
Workshop attendees must pay the conference registration fee.<br><br>

Please note that due to a limited number of rooms at the conference venue, we will only be able to 
accept a very small number of workshops.  We encourage submitters to contact us before the deadline 
if there is any concern about overlap with other similar workshop topics.<br><br>
