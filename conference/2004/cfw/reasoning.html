Call for Participation<br><br>
<strong>Workshop on Protégé and Reasoning</strong><br><br>
Tuesday July 6th, 2004<br>
Bethesda, Maryland<br><br>
<em>In conjunction with the Seventh International Protégé Conference</em><br><br>

Prot&eacute;g&eacute; was originally designed as a development tool for ontologies and knowledge bases with the assumption that 
the Prot&eacute;g&eacute; output was to be used by a separate reasoning engine. Recently, the Prot&eacute;g&eacute; community 
has developed extensions that allow reasoning engines to integrate with the Prot&eacute;g&eacute; environment. Examples of such
integration efforts are JessTab, Algernon, PrologTab and ClipsTab.<br><br>

This workshop brings together researchers and practitioners with an interest in various aspects of reasoning and problem solving 
in the Prot&eacute;g&eacute; environment. Topics include, but are not limited to:

<ul>
	<li>Reasoning engines as plug-ins to Prot&eacute;g&eacute;</li>
	<li>The use of Protégé as a component of a reasoning engine or problem solver</li>
	<li>Communication between reasoning engines and Prot&eacute;g&eacute;</li>
	<li>Reusable problem-solving methods</li>
	<li>Prot&eacute;g&eacute; output formats suitable for external reasoning engines</li>
	<li>Optimized Prot&eacute;g&eacute; APIs for efficient reasoning</li>
	<li>Innovative use of the Prot&eacute;g&eacute; Java API for reasoning</li>
	<li>Comparisons of different reasoning engines and problem solvers</li>
	<li>Future challenges and the need for further integration efforts</li>
	<li>Developer reports from practical use of reasoning engines in Prot&eacute;g&eacute;</li>
</ul>

The workshop format is a series of presentations followed by a general discussion. If
you wish to make a presentation at the workshop, you should submit a two-page
abstract to the organizer by e-mail no later than June 1, 2004. If you would like to
attend (without giving a presentation), it is sufficient to submit a brief statement of
interest to the organizer by e-mail no later than June 1, 2004.<br><br>
