Enterprise Vocabulary Development in Protege/OWL:  Workflow and Concept History Requirements

Sherri De Coronado, Gilberto Fragoso (NCI)

The National Cancer Institute has developed the NCI Thesaurus, a rich and
complex vocabulary that provides consistent, unambiguous codes and
definitions for concepts used in cancer research.  A lexical component
provides human usable definition and other information.  Description logic
is used to ensure complete, consistent and non-redundant definitions in the
formal sense.  NCI Thesaurus enables retrieval of information across a wide
range of domains used in cancer research, facilitating translational
research. This vocabulary was originally built using Ontylog, a proprietary
description logic developed explicitly for building large complex
terminologies.  We have converted the Ontylog version of NCI Thesaurus to
OWL, and are beginning to test the features of Protege OWL in a multi-user
environment with a database backend to determine whether it could be used be
used to support the operational needs of NCI Thesaurus development and
maintenance.  Other tools such as Prompt and PromptViz would allow us to
visualize and review changes between development baselines.  However, we
anticipate additional work that would include the modification, via plugins
or directly on the code base (in collaboration with the Protege team), of
Protege to support workflow in a collaborative environment, as well as
concept history tracking and various (NCI) business rules.
