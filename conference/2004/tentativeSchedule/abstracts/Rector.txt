Understanding the logical meaning of any description logic or similar formalism is difficult for most people, and OWL-DL is no exception. This paper presents the most common difficulties encountered by newcomers to the language, that have been observed during the course of more than a dozen workshops, tutorials and modules about OWL-DL and it’s predecessor languages. It emphasises understanding the exactly meaning of OWL expressions – proving that understanding by paraphrasing them in pedantic but explicit language. It addresses, specifically, the confusion which OWL’s open world assumption presents to users accustomed to closed world systems such as databases, logic programming and frame languages. The experience has had a major influence in formulating the requirements for a new set of interfaces for OWL the first of which are now available as prototypes. A summary of the guidelines and paraphrases and examples of the new interface are provided. The example ontologies are available online.
