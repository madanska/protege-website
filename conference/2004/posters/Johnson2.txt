Description:
The Eclipse Platform (http://www.eclipse.org) provides an 
extensible open source framework for tools integration. While this framework is 
separate from the Protégé application and plug-in architecture, it is possible 
to provide meaningful interaction between the two environments.

Historically, there have been barriers to establishing this interaction, 
foremost being incompatible widget toolkits (Eclipse SWT versus JFC/Swing). 
However, this situation has changed with the introduction of Eclipse Version 
3.0, which allows Swing-based components to reside within Eclipse-based 
views.

This poster will demonstrate interaction between the two environments, 
highlighted by working examples. We will disseminate code to monitor Protégé 
events from Eclipse plug-ins, as well as to communicate with Protégé objects and 
user interface components from Eclipse views.

In addition to demonstration, we are hopeful that the poster session will 
encourage informal discussion regarding potential enhancements and future 
direction for this work.
