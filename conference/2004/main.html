The Seventh International Prot&eacute;g&eacute; Conference will take place at the National Institutes of Health in 
Bethesda, Maryland from July 6-9, 2004. Please mark these dates on your calendar and plan to join us for a few days 
this summer. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) campus offers easy access to the 
Washington metro system and all the attractions that Washington has to offer.<br><br>

We would like to thank the National Cancer Institute Center for Bioinformatics (NCICB) and the National 
Library of Medicine (NLM) for their extremely generous contributions which have made this conference possible. 
<br><br>

The conference brings together researchers developing or using 
<a href="http://protege.stanford.edu" target="_blank">Prot&eacute;g&eacute;</a> methodologies and tools and is 
the premier forum for discussion about current and future applications 
of the Prot&eacute;g&eacute; approach. The seventh meeting builds on the success of previous meetings in 
<a href="../2003/index.html" target="_blank">Manchester</a>, 
<a href="http://www.schin.ncl.ac.uk/protege2001/index.asp" target="_blank">Newcastle</a>, 
<a href="http://www.ida.liu.se/~her/protege-ws.html" target="_blank">Linköping</a>, Lidingö, Pavia, and Palo Alto. 
The conference provides a great opportunity to appreciate the breadth of applications of the technology, to share 
new developments in the field, and to find out how to leverage these developments in practice.<br><br>

Due to a rapid annual increase in attendance, the format this year has been changed from a workshop to a conference. The first 
day will consist of tutorials and small focused workshops. The remaining two and a half days of the main conference will 
include presentations, a poster session, and a demo session. This year there will be a review process resulting in a smaller 
number of presentations.<br><br>

Questions about the conference?  Send <a href="mailto:protege-conf-organizers@lists.stanford.edu">email</a> to the 
conference organizers.<br>

We look forward to seeing as many of you as possible at the meeting.<br><br><br>
