The Seventh International Prot&eacute;g&eacute; Conference will be held on July 6-9, 2004. The 
meeting will take place at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland. This meeting 
is traditionally a forum for users to meet one another and the Protege team and for us to meet 
you. We discuss common problems and solutions as well as current activities and plans. The 
meetings are fairly informal and also help the Prot&eacute;g&eacute; team to set priorities for 
development work. This will be the first meeting to take place in North America in over 8 years, 
following a long series of very successful meetings in Europe.<br><br>
