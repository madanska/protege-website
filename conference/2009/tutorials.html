		<li>
		<a name="owl-intro"></a>
		<span class="bodyTextTitle">Introduction to OWL</span><br /> 
		(Prot&eacute;g&eacute; Staff)<br /><br />
		
		OWL is the W3C standard ontology language for the Semantic Web, and Prot&eacute;g&eacute;-OWL the most widely used editing tool for OWL.  This 
		three-part tutorial introduces OWL ontology development with Prot&eacute;g&eacute;-OWL, presents the majors features of the OWL-DL languages, and 
		explains how to leverage these features for performing advanced reasoning tasks.  This will be a &quot;hands-on&quot; adaptation and extension of the 
		famous 
		<a href="http://owl.cs.manchester.ac.uk/tutorials/protegeowltutorial/" target="_blank">Prot&eacute;g&eacute;-OWL pizza tutorial</a>.  
		The three parts are in continuity, but intermediate resources will be provided so that participants 
		can attend only the second, the third, or the second and third parts depending on their level of expertise.<br /><br />
		
		The first part of the tutorial covers the basic language elements of OWL (classes, properties, and individuals) and shows how they can be edited 
		with Prot&eacute;g&eacute;-OWL. The goal of this session is to demonstrate how to create the various elements of a pizza ontology and how to 
		structure this ontology. The intended audience is users not familiar with the Prot&eacute;g&eacute;-OWL editor or with the OWL language.<br /><br />
		
		The second part of the tutorial introduces the semantics of the OWL language constructs. We will explore more complex OWL class descriptions by showing 
		how different types of restrictions can be used to enhance the logical meaning of classes, after which we will discuss the important notion of primitive 
		and defined classes. The goal of this session is to demonstrate how to use the richness of the OWL language both for providing an accurate description 
		of a domain knowledge and for using this knowledge in order to make the development and maintenance of the ontology easier and safer. The intended 
		audience comprises those who attended the first part and those who want to have an introduction to the semantics of the OWL language.<br /><br />

		The third part of the tutorial introduces a more advanced exploitation of the reasoning power of OWL. We will cover the open world assumption and 
		compare class and instance-based reasoning. The intended audience comprises those who attended the second part and those who want to get an in-depth 
		understanding of the capabilities of OWL reasoning.<br /><br /><br />

		<a name="reasoning"></a>
		<span class="bodyTextTitle">Properties and Individuals in OWL: Reasoning About Family History</span><br />
		(Robert Stevens and Simon Jupp)<br /><br />
		
		This tutorial has the aim of enabling attendees to learn about how to use OWL individuals and the inferences that can be made about them with 
		automated reasoning. This intermediate level tutorial will take attendees deeper in to the use of properties, their characteristics, and property 
		hierarchies to describe and reason about individuals in a family history. It will be a &quot;hands-on&quot; tutorial that will use the case study 
		of family history. Attendees will create individual family members, assert only parents and siblings and then infer a whole host of other family 
		relationships.<br /><br />
		
		The objectives of the tutorial are:
		
		<ol style="padding-top:11px; padding-bottom:11px;">
			<li>Understand the separation of OWL knowledge bases into TBox and ABox.</li>
			<li>Understand the difference between classes and individuals; when should individuals be used?</li>
			<li>Asserting facts about individuals (property assertions and class assertions).</li>
			<li>Understanding inferences: The effects of property hierarchies, property characteristics, property chains and domain/range constraints.</li>
			<li>The ramifications of the open world assumption.</li>
			<li>Introducing the use of nominals (blurring the Tbox ABox distinction).</li>
			<li>Understanding the limits of OWL2 when reasoning about instances.</li>
		</ol>
		
		Attendees are expected to be familiar with the material available in Manchester's 
		<a href="http://owl.cs.manchester.ac.uk/tutorials/protegeowltutorial/" target="_blank">introduction to writing ontologies in OWL</a>, though the 
		tutorial will entail some revision. Much of the tutorial will be &quot;hands-on&quot;, so attendees should have a computer with a 
		<a href="http://protege.stanford.edu/download/registered.html#p4" target="_blank">copy of Protege 4</a>, though this is not absolutely essential.

		<span class="bodyTextTitle">Understanding and Repairing Inferences</span><br />
		(Matthew Horridge)<br /><br />
		
		The Web Ontology Langauge, OWL, became a World Wide Web Consortium Standard in February 2004. Since then it has probably become the most widely 
		used ontology language, being adopted all over the world by academia and industry alike. As well as being extensively used in the field of computer 
		science, OWL is used by many domain experts in diverse areas such as bioinformatics, medicine, and geography. One of the key aspects of OWL is that 
		it is built upon the foundations of a Description Logic. This logical foundation gives statements made in OWL a well defined meaning. Moreover, it 
		makes it possible to specify various automated reasoning tasks, and to use &quot;off the shelf&quot; description logic reasoners such as FaCT++, 
		HermiT, Pellet, and Racer. With reasoning, knowledge that was implicit, but not stated in the original ontology, can be made explicit---knowledge 
		can be inferred. A consequence of the fact that OWL is underpinned by a highly expressive description logic, is that unexpected or undesirable 
		entailments (inferences) can arise in ontologies.<br /><br />
		
		The reasons as to why an entailment arises in an ontology can range from fairly simple localized reasons through to highly non-obvious reasons. 
		In the case of very large ontologies, manually pinpointing the reasons for an entailment can be a wretched and error prone task, especially as 
		it may be a very small percentage of the ontology that is responsible for the entailment.  Without some kind of tool support it can be very 
		difficult to track down and understand the reasons for entailments.<br /><br />
		
		Tool support in the form of an explanation workbench plug-in has recently been made available for Prot&eacute;g&eacute; 4.  This plug-in makes it 
		possible to obtain and browse explanations for entailments.  Using the explanation workbench plug-in, the tutorial will introduce explanation of 
		entailments in OWL. With a mixture of theory and practice, participants will first be introduced to the terminology and main ideas behind 
		explanation, and will then be able to gain hands on experience of browsing and understanding explanations for inferences in Prot&eacute;g&eacute; 4.
		<br /><br />
		
		Specifically, the tutorial will cover:
		
		<ul style="padding-top:11px; padding-bottom:11px;">
			<li>Entailments (inferences) in OWL
				<ul>
					<li>A recap of the types of entailments that can arise in ontologies</li>

		It is expected that participants will have a basic understanding of OWL and that they will have at least browsed, if not built, OWL ontologies in 
		Prot&eacute;g&eacute;. Participants might first like to attend the OWL modelling and reasoning tutorials.<br /><br />
		
		This tutorial will be given by <a href="http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~horridgm" target="_blank">Matthew Horridge</a>.  Matthew is a Research Associate 
		in the School of Computer Science at the University of Manchester.  He conducts research in the area of explanation in OWL.  Matthew also led the 
		initial design and development of version 4.0 of the Prot&eacute;g&eacute;-OWL editor.<br /><br /><br />

		<span class="bodyTextTitle">Collaborative Ontology Development with Prot&eacute;g&eacute;</span><br />
		(Tania Tudorache, Jennifer Vendetti, Natasha Noy, Timothy Redmond)<br /><br />
		
		In recent years, collaborative ontology development has become one of the &quot;hot topics&quot; in the ontology and Semantic Web communities. 
		<a href="http://protege.stanford.edu">Prot&eacute;g&eacute; 3.4</a> already provides features that allow a community of users to simultaneously edit an ontology, 
		discuss the ontology content, and document these discussions in the context of the ontology. Users are also able to start change proposals, vote, browse, 
		and discuss the change history of an ontology component. Other features include chat, filtering, and the ability to search the discussions in the ontology. 
		Users may edit the ontology either in the 
		<a href="http://protegewiki.stanford.edu/index.php/Collaborative_Protege" target="_blank">Collaborative Protege</a> client - an extension of 
		the Prot&eacute;g&eacute; desktop application, or in <a href="http://protegewiki.stanford.edu/index.php/WebProtege" target="_blank">WebProtege</a> - a lightweight, web-based 
		ontology editor.<br /><br />
		
		In this hands-on tutorial, you will learn how to set up and use the collaborative Prot&eacute;g&eacute; environment. In the first part of the tutorial, 
		we will set up a 
		Prot&eacute;g&eacute; server, create users, and configure the projects and their access policies. Then we will learn how to set up a project for 
		collaboration and how to create the changes and annotation ontology. We will also partially cover the set-up of WebProt&eacute;g&eacute;.<br /><br />
		
		In the second part of the tutorial, we will split into small groups and collaboratively edit an ontology using Collaborative Prot&eacute;g&eacute; 
		and WebProt&eacute;g&eacute;. During this exercise, you will learn how to create different types of notes attached to a particular class in the ontology, 
		how to browse and comment on the change history, how to use the chat feature, and many other tips and tricks. All other features of the 
		collaborative environment will be covered. You will learn how to configure WebProt&eacute;g&eacute; and how to layout the user interface to suit different 
		needs and user expertise levels.<br /><br />
		
		If you plan to follow the hands-on portion of the tutorial, basic experience with navigating the Prot&eacute;g&eacute; user interface will be assumed. 
		Attendees should know how to perform rudimentary tasks such as opening projects and creating new classes, slots, and instances.<br /><br />

		<a name="swrl-tab"></a>
		<span class="bodyTextTitle">SWRLTab Tutorial</span><br />
		(Martin O'Connor)<br /><br />
		
		This tutorial will provide an in depth look at the SWRLTab, a development environment for working with Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) rules in 
		Prot&eacute;g&eacute;-OWL. The tutorial will provide an introduction to the SWRL language. Hands-on sessions will cover the authoring of rules 
		using the SWRL Editor and the execution of rules using the SWRLJessTab. The set of libraries provided by the SWRLTab will also be covered. These 
		libraries can be used in SWRL rules and include collections of mathematical, string, and temporal operators, in addition to operators that can be 
		used to effectively turn SWRL into a query language.<br /><br />
		
		The target audience member is an existing Prot&eacute;g&eacute;-OWL user. Attendance at the OWL Tutorial or previous familiarity with basic OWL 
		concepts are minimal requirements.<br /><br /><br />

	    <span class="bodyTextTitle">Developing Prot&eacute;g&eacute; 4 Plug-ins</span><br />
		(Nick Drummond, Matthew Horridge, Timothy Redmond)<br /><br />
		
		Prot&eacute;g&eacute; has always been designed to allow developers to add features.  Prot&eacute;g&eacute; 4 is no different and is based on a 
		framework that allows easy implementation and extension of plug-ins.  This tutorial will guide you through the basics of developing plug-ins for 
		Prot&eacute;g&eacute; 4. As this is a short session and aimed at developers we would like to keep the format loose.<br /><br />
		
		We will aim to cover the following topics:
		
		<ul style="padding-top:11px; padding-bottom:11px;">
			<li>guidelines for developers</li>
			<li>plug-in types</li>
			<li>Prot&eacute;g&eacute; 4 architecture overview</li>
			<li>OSGi/equinox basics</li>
			<li>OWL API introduction</li>
			<li>Useful Prot&eacute;g&eacute; 4 UI components</li>
		</ul>
		
		It is an aim of the tutorial that participants should leave with enough knowledge to start implementing a simple plug-in.  An understanding of 
		Java and familiarity with Java development environments (IDEs) is assumed.<br /><br /><br />

	    <span class="bodyTextTitle">JessTab Tutorial</span><br />
		(Henrik Eriksson)<br /><br />
		
		This tutorial will introduce the 
		<a href="http://www.ida.liu.se/%7Eher/JessTab/" target="_blank">JessTab extension</a>, 
		which enables the use of the 
		<a href="http://herzberg.ca.sandia.gov/jess/" target="_blank">Java Expert System Shell (Jess)</a> 
		under Prot&eacute;g&eacute;. The tutorial will cover basic Jess programming, rule-based reasoning with Jess under 
		Prot&eacute;g&eacute;, and the use of Jess for managing Prot&eacute;g&eacute; ontologies and knowledge bases. 
		Furthermore, the tutorial will address the mapping of instances in Prot&eacute;g&eacute; knowledge bases to Jess 
		facts and use of the JessTab with both Prot&eacute;g&eacute;-Frames and Prot&eacute;g&eacute;-OWL. The tutorial will 
		exemplify practical uses of Jess together with Prot&eacute;g&eacute; and discuss common design patterns. The tutorial 
		will demonstrate how to install Jess and the JessTab and how to interact with the JessTab. The target audience is 
		developers interested in combining ontologies and reasoning. No prior knowledge of Jess or the JessTab is required.
