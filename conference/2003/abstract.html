      <p> <font color="#006600" size="3">&quot;Terminological systems (TSs) continue 
        to form a hot research topic in medical informatics. Frameworks for understanding 
        TSs have been suggested which provide a typology of TSs along with conceptual 
        and formal specification of TS desiderata. These Frameworks provide guidance 
        in the analysis and design phases of developing a TS but the actual implementation 
        of TSs is still left as an exercise to the TS developer. However, software 
        development environments such as Prot&eacute;g&eacute; have been devised 
        for the flexible construction of knowledge based-systems from components. 
        Features of Prot&eacute;g&eacute; include its conformance to the OKBC 
        knowledge model; the logical separation between ontology and application; 
        and its componential architecture. In this talk we investigate the compatibility 
        of Prot&eacute;g&eacute; with the conceptual framework for understanding 
        Terminological Systems suggested in (de Keizer and Abu-Hanna, 2000). We 
        address the compatibility issue by a constructive approach that provides 
        mappings between the conceptual components of the TS framework and Prot&eacute;g&eacute; 
        constructs. The development of an intensive care terminology system,<br>
        called DICE, is used as a case study.<br>

      <p> <font color="#006600" size="3">Academic groups, especially in university 
        settings, tend to experience high turnover rates of personnel. Whether 
        it is formal knowledge about particular research topics, or informal knowledge 
        about the social network within the group, such knowledge is closely tied 
        to the specific student, and often leaves with them; consequently, new 
        additions to the group are forced to re-acquire this knowledge through 
        experience.<br>
        We have observed these problems in our own research group - the CHISEL 
        (Computer-Human Interaction and Software Engineering Lab) group at the 
        University of Victoria, Canada. In this presentation, we will describe 
        how we used Prot&eacute;g&eacute; to create a knowledge-based recommender 
        system that captures and shares knowledge about group members and the 
        papers they have read in certain research areas. This system includes 
        a web interface for knowledge capture, and is integrated with a commercial, 
        off-the-shelf tool called EndNote for integrating bibliographic references 
        with popular word-processing tools. We show how,using a visualization 
        plug-in for Prot&eacute;g&eacute; called Jambalaya, we were better able 
        to share this knowledge with the group and discover new properties of 
        the group knowledge base. We will also report on our experiences using 
        Prot&eacute;g&eacute; to create such a system.</font><font color="#006600" size="3"><br>

      <p> <font color="#006600" size="3">Pellucid is a project, funded by the 
        European IST programme, concerned with knowledge management for public 
        employees, specifically for those who are organisationally mobile, moving 
        from one department or post to another. This presentation illustrates 
        our experience in using Prot&eacute;g&eacute; in Pellucid. <br>
        The architecture of the Pellucid system consists of a set of cooperating 
        agents, taking care of monitoring, reasoning and interfacing, implemented 
        in JADE; an organisational memory, containing the &#8220;history&#8221; 
        of the organisation; and a workflow system, modelling the processes and 
        activities within the organisation. Ontologies are used to support agent 
        communication and reasoning. Two kind of ontologies were modelled: generic 
        ontologies, representing part of the organisational model used in the 
        workflow system, and domain specific ontologies, representing particular 
        functionalities of the system such as contact, document and time-critical 
        management, and to be extended into the particular domains of work of 
        the organizations.<br>
        Ontologies have been implemented using Prot&eacute;g&eacute;. The Ontoviz 
        Tab plug-in was employed to visualise ontology elements and the Bean Generator 
        plug-in was employed to represent ontologies in the Java format used by 
        JADE. We also use Prot&eacute;g&eacute; in the deployment phase as a mechanism 
        for populating the organisational memory. We explore some challenges presented 
        in the use of Prot&eacute;g&eacute; and describe future work.</font></p>

        linked to a frame, and a tab plug-in to configure the connection between 
        Prot&eacute;g&eacute; and Java archives and classes. To illustrate the 
        functions of the plug-ins I will present a small example project as work

      <p> <font color="#006600" size="3">Kasimir is a decision-support system 
        currently under development for breast cancer treatment. It relies on 
        knowledge bases (implemented within a specific XML format) representing 
        clinical guidelines, and on a inference engine that classifies concepts 
        representing domain knowledge. As in a description logic framework, concepts 
        are divided into primitive and defined concepts.<br>
        The increasing size of Kasimir knowledge bases led us to study and use 
        a knowledge editing tool. The use of such a tool has become a necessity 
        regarding the Kasimir system evolution. The choice of Prot&eacute;g&eacute;-2000 
        to fulfil this task was made after a number of Web search for adequate 
        tools, comparison, evaluation, and discussion among the team developing 
        the Kasimir system. Thanks to the metaclass architecture in Prot&eacute;g&eacute;-2000, 
        the Kasimir knowledge representation model can be described and, according 
        to this model, Prot&eacute;g&eacute; generates forms suitable to the editing 
        process. Then, Prot&eacute;g&eacute; classes (corresponding to domain 
        concepts in Kasimir) can be checked by the Kasimir knowledge representation 
        engine in the Kasimir plug-in before being exported to XML files. <br>
        Visualisation of huge hierarchies also led to the development of graphical 
        plug-ins helping the user in the editing phase. One of these<br>
        tools gives the possibility to see changes (added, deleted, modified concepts) 
        within Prot&eacute;g&eacute; project during the editing session.</font></p>

        been carried out during the &#8220;extrovert-Gadgets&#8221; project (<a href="http://www.extrovert-gadgets.net" target="_blank">http://www.extrovert-gadgets.net</a>), 
        a research project funded in the context of EU IST/FET proactive initiative 
        &#8220;Disappearing Computer&#8221; (<a href="http://www.disappearing-computer.net" target="_blank">http://www.disappearing-computer.net</a>). 
        In this project everyday tangible (physical) objects, referred to as eGadgets, 
        are enhanced with sensing, acting, processing and communication abilities, 
        and are able to communicate and collaborate, constituting eGadgetworlds. 
        The Gadgetware Architectural Style (GAS) defines the concepts and mechanisms 
        that will allow people to compose eGadgetworlds by associating eGadgets 
        and use them in a consistent and intuitive way. Each eGadget runs a small 
        operating system (GAS-OS), which locally manages its resources and associations.<br>
        GAS Ontology aims to conceptualize GAS by describing the semantics of 
        its basic terms and defining the relations among these terms. Thus GAS 
        Ontology provides a shared means for the communication and collaboration 
        among eGadgets, even though they may be produced by different manufacturers. 
        Prot&eacute;g&eacute;-2000 was selected as the suitable tool for the development 
        of GAS Ontology. For this we have developed an evaluation framework for 
        ontology development tools. For the management of GAS Ontology as well 
        as for the facilitation of knowledge sharing and reuse, we are developing 
        the Ontology Manager module. This will be an integral part of the GAS-OS 
        kernel, as every association among eGadgets starts with a negotiation 
        on commonly understood protocols, functions and data types. We intend 
        to develop the Ontology Manager in such a way that it will use and enhance 
        techniques and methods for querying of Prot&eacute;g&eacute;-2000.</font></p>

        knowledge-intensive tasks by processing domain knowledge. Well-known PSMs 
        are propose-and-revise and heuristic classification, that have been used 
        to tackle tasks such as constraint-satisfaction, classification and diagnosis 
        in domains such as elevator configuration, ribosome-conformation prediction 
        and diagnosis of arthritic conditions.<br>
        </font><font color="#006600">A PSM provides both a formal model of a generic 
        reasoning process, and a piece of program code that implements it. As 
        such, PSMs serve as reasoning building blocks that can be assembled with 
        a domain knowledge base to create a running knowledge system. PSMs are 
        typically collected in libraries, that help indexing and retrieving PSMs 
        for different purposes and contexts. In particular, PSM libraries formalize 
        the properties, capabilities and requirements of the PSMs available, using 
        a specification language such as the Unified Problem-solving Method development 
        Language (UPML). Because PSMs are domain-independent, selecting and adapting 
        one for its reuse in a domain-specific knowledge application are non-trivial 
        activities.<br>
        </font><font color="#006600">In this talk, I will present the PSM Librarian--a 
        tool that plugs into Prot&eacute;g&eacute; to support users in creating 
        knowledge-based application by integrating domain-knowledge components 
        and PSMs. In particular, the PSM Librarian helps users in: (1) browsing 
        and selecting a PSM suitable for the task and domain at-hand, and (2) 
        configuring that PSM for the specific domain by declaring explicit mapping 
        relations between domain entities and the inputs and outputs of the PSM. 
        Used with a domain project, the PSM Librarian tab serves as a front-end 
        interface to a set of UPML-specified PSM libraries (using a Prot&eacute;g&eacute;-based 
        UPML editor) and provides navigation and edition support for the selection 
        and configuration of PSMs available.</font></p>

      <p><font color="#006600" size="3">As a part of organization studies review 
        and qualitative meta-analysis of research done, an ontology of concepts 
        was compiled and unified with the framework of organizational structure, 
        process, and boundary (Pettigrew, 2000) that becomes accepted in the field 
        of organization theory. Then, such library of organization analysis elements 
        was populated with information from an empirical case study &shy; relations, 
        authority, and other elements of social structure were codified as instances 
        of concepts.<br>
        While such application of the Prot&eacute;g&eacute; is helpful in ordering, 
        visualising, and questioning knowledge structure of a field (new relations 
        among concepts, frameworks rearrangement), advantages and perils for the 
        use of Prot&eacute;g&eacute; for theorizing, collaboration on research 
        knowledge, and as a R&amp;D tool in general are yet to be established.<br>
        Key discussion issues appear as the following: (1) need of significant 
        knowledge of field analysed as well as theory behind Prot&eacute;g&eacute; 
        (object-oriented design, ontology, frame-based systems, OKBC); (2) putting 
        rich and often broad or loosely-coupled theoretical frameworks is compromised 
        with the object-oriented paradigm and ontology format, for instance, a 
        typical choice, ontology design issue, would be between a child and a 
        parent concept (object); (3) keeping track of meanings behind constructs 
        combined and remembering heuristics and conventions made for encoding 
        of information in one rather than other way; (4) lack of opportunity to 
        reframe and export research data for further statistical analysis; (5) 
        use of Prot&eacute;g&eacute; for transfer of empirical data in form of 
        some standard ontology.</font><font color="#006600" size="3"> </font>

        is the design of knowledge engineering tools and knowledge engineering 
        processes to ensure the widest possible adoption. Prot&eacute;g&eacute;, 
        with 8000 registered users, has a relatively large user base for this 
        community, but evolving web standards for the Semantic Web promise to 
        greatly increase this community. This talk looks at some issues involved 
        in making the tools and techniques of Prot&eacute;g&eacute; and its plugins 
        accessible and available to a wider audience. In turn, wide adoption will 
        benefit the projects that choose to focus on it by increasing the user-base.

        support to the potential user.</font></p>

      <p><font color="#006600" size="3">Ontologies are recognized as a key technology 
        for knowledge sharing. A key task for health informatics is to model health 
        care domain knowledge into ontologies. Within health care it is inevitable 
        that we must deal with heterogeneous types and sources of knowledge, information 
        and data. When incorporating multiple paradigms into ontologies we are 
        faced not only with differences in underlying knowledge, but also with 
        conflicts in the terminology used. In this presentation we identify the 
        difficulties of modelling heterogeneous domain knowledge within a single 
        ontology and explore ways of overcoming those difficulties. Within the 
        presentation we will explore an ontology for a unified traditional Chinese 
        medical language system which is being designed in China. Prot&eacute;g&eacute; 
        is being used both to construct the ontology and in knowledge acquisition. 
        We will make comparisons with possible representations for Orthodox Western 
        Medicine. Both Chinese Medicine and Orthodox Western Medicine deal with 
        the human health condition. Much could be gained from effective knowledge 
        sharing. However, despite superficial similarities in terminology, these 
        two disciplines come from very different paradigms. Sowa recognised that 
        no fixed collection of distinctions or categories is likely to be adequate 
        for describing all things for all time &shy; even under a single paradigm. 
        We go further by arguing that different flexible sets of distinctions 
        or categories are needed for modelling domain knowledge from different 
        paradigms.</font></p>

        economical means of knowledge representation than traditional frame-based 
        techniques. A metaclass can be considered as a sort of approximate entity 
        in the sense that it does not contain unnecessary details. In this presentation 
        we will propose a way of representing three types of reified relations 
        using metaclass frames in Prot&eacute;g&eacute; to model the medical domain 
        knowledge: namely, mereotopological relations, functional relations, and 
        property-value-type relations. We will also address the issue of defeasible

        Conflicting records (as to function, structure, etc.) will thus either 
        be avoided or can serve to restructure the ontology itself. Although the

      <p><font color="#006600" size="3"> On the face of it, description logic 
        languages and tools such as OWL/OilEd and frame based languages and tools 
        such as OKBC and Protege appear to be addressing very similar tasks. However, 
        on closer examination their goals and assumptions are more different than 
        it at first seems. Most often, what is required is not just an ontology 
        but an &quot;Knowledge base anchored in an ontology&quot;. Description 
        logics can provide the hierarchy of domain categories (classes) based 
        on their intensions but not the knowledge base of contingent facts about 
        the members of those categories nor can they provide the metaknowledge 
        and annotations required to make the ontology usable and maintainable.<br>
        Description logics provide a formal semantics for reasoning about universal 
        conditions concerning domain categories based on first order logic. All 
        their statements are of the form: in any possible world, all instances 
        of this category must satisfy this condition. Using such statements, they 
        allow complex polyhierarchies of domain categories to be inferred and 
        managed more easily and reliably than manual methods. These hierarchies 
        are useful precisely because they are independent of any particular database 
        or &quot;world&quot;.<br>
        However, this is all description logics do. They provide no means either 
        of stating facts about the categories themselves (metaknowledge) or of 
        stating contingent facts concerning the instances of those categories 
        in some particular closed database or &quot;world&quot;. To provide intuitive 
        access to metaknowledge, knowledge about instances, reasoning about this 
        a specific world under a 'closed world' hypothesis, or managing defaults 
        and exceptions in a way which allows sensible software engineering, requires 
        supplementation. The traditional frame representations provide a basis 
        for such hybrid reasoning. Some applications may require till further 
        reasoning and computational mechanisms for specific functions but mechanisms 
        such as Protege's plug-and-play structure provide a natural means of extension 
        for such separable but closely coupled mechanisms.<br>
        This is not a theoretical problem. Practical applications require a wide 
        range of knowledge, some of it universally true, some of it contingent. 
        They require metaknowledge in several forms - editorial information, documentation 
        for users, and meta-knowledge about the categories themselves - e.g. that 
        they are &quot;well accepted&quot; or &quot;controversial&quot;. On the 
        other hand, maintaining a complex polyhierarchy which satisfies the needs 
        of multiple domains so as to be widely re-usable has proved a daunting 
        task without the support provided by the strong semantics of description 
        logics or similar mechanisms.<br>
        This talk will explore a series of specific cases in which the hierarchy 
        of domain categories is best managed using DL tools such as OWL, but other 
        knowledge and the &quot;Ontology Anchored Knowledge Base&quot; is based 
        captured in a more frame like way.</font></p>

      <p><font color="#006600" size="3"> Terminology describes how information 
        can be classified, while information models describe how information can 
        be represented. The boundary between terminology and information models 
        can be quite fluid, with the same assertion represented as a terminological 
        element in one application and in an information structure in the second. 
        Decisions about where this boundary occurs depend on the primary purpose 
        of the application, what terminology was available at the time the decisions 
        were made and an assortment of other technology and performance constraints.<br>
        </font><font color="#006600" size="3">Applications such as automated guidelines 
        and decision support modules need to represent information in a representational 
        neutral fashion. While they need to be able to accurately and explicitly 
        describe the information needed to drive the logic, the decisions about 
        what is terminology and what is information model must be postponed until 
        the guidelines are applied to an actual information system.<br>

        that Prot&eacute;g&eacute; can be used to blur this distinction by representing 
        terminological constructs to Prot&eacute;g&eacute; as imported slots and 
        classes while, at the same time, allowing new classes and slots authored 
        in Prot&eacute;g&eacute; to be represented externally as terminological

      <p> <font color="#006600" size="3">Current trends in knowledge engineering 
        advise to carry out the knowledge base development by extending domain 
        ontology with specific knowledge of each particular application. In addition, 
        reusing pre-existing knowledge sources may give rise to knowledge bases 
        endowed with a common and standard terminology. But, reuse often requires 
        an enormous effort, so few knowledge-based applications have arisen following 
        this approach.</font><br>
        <font color="#006600" size="3">In this work, we analyze some problems 
        that make reuse difficult, as well as types of activities and current 
        available resources<br>
        that may contribute to improve this process. In particular, we present 
        the characteristics of a case study of the development of a KB for a specific 
        medical domain. The purpose of the KB is to support an electronic guideline 
        in ophthalmology taken from the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) 
        Web site (<a href="http://www.aao.org/aao/education/library/ppp.cfm" target="_blank">http://www.aao.org/aao/education/library/ppp.cfm</a>). 
        So, we need a sufficiently general methodology for both the modeling of 
        an ontology (the core of our KB) and its extension with specific details.<br>
        </font><font color="#006600" size="3">1) We have used the tool Prot&eacute;g&eacute;-2000, 
        which is an ontology design and knowledge acquisition tool.<br>
        2) For modeling the core of the KB, we have found the use of more than 
        one ontology very useful. In order to simplify the merging of these ontologies, 
        we have chosen PROMPT for several reasons. Firstly, it allows merging 
        of source ontologies into a resulting ontology. We have found this feature 
        very useful, as development and merging time is reduced, on the contrary 
        to those tools that only provide similarities and differences as a result. 
        Secondly, it analyses source concepts, properties (including restriction 
        on value properties) and relationships. Thirdly, it is interactive with 
        the user, allowing us to accept or reject the suggestions.<br>
        3) We have also revised and selected specific concepts from the Unified 
        Medical Language System (UMLS). This server has been developed and is 
        maintained by the U.S.A. National Library of Medicine. The embodiment 
        of these specific concepts in our KB is not only a process consisting 
        of the specialization of the core ontology (i.e., consisting of the adding 
        instances). In general, it is a development process similar to ontology 
        design.</font></p>

        The Gene Ontology</em></font><font color="#006600" size="4">&quot;:</font></strong></p>
      <p> <font color="#006600" size="3">The Gene Ontology (GO <a href="http://www.geneontology.org" target="_blank">http://www.geneontology.org</a>) 
        is a structured precisely defined common controlled vocabulary for describing 
        the roles of genes and gene products in any organism. It has undergone 
        rapid development and in a short time has become widely adopted in the 
        molecular biology community. Its 14,000 concepts have been used to annotate 
        over 850,000 gene product instances. Success however brings challenges 
        in (i) maintaining complex multiple hierarchies (ii) guarding against 
        a combinatorial explosion of new concepts (iii) making concept definitions 
        machine interpretable. The Gene Ontology Next Generation project (GONG 
        <a href="http://gong.man.ac.uk" target="_blank">http://gong.man.ac.uk</a>) 
        is a collaboration with members of the Gene Ontology consortium, which 
        is demonstrating how description logic (DL) and in particular the DL language 
        DAML+OIL can help in maintaining GO. By producing formal DAML+OIL definitions 
        for GO concepts, we have shown how DL reasoning can be used to critique 
        the existing GO structure and suggest amendments subsequently accepted 
        by GO editors. We will present the methodology for creating these definitions 
        and specific examples of the results of reasoning.<br>
        Producing DAML+OIL definitions requires detailed knowledge of the language, 
        yet we cannot expect domain experts to acquire such knowledge. Therefore 
        GONG is also developing simplified context specific views of the underlying 
        DAML+OIL to encapsulate this knowledge. We will demonstrate how such a 
        view enables domain experts to record definitions in a more straightforward 
        manner. <br>
        Many existing GO concepts are the composition of two of more elemental 
        concepts to form a more complex phrase e.g. &#8216;heparin metabolism&#8217;. 
        If a users wants to describe a gene product instance as metabolising some 
        new class of chemical, they must ask the Gene Ontology editors to add 
        that new combination. DL based ontologies provide the capability to build 
        compositions as required. The Gene Ontology Annotation Tool (GOAT <a href="http://goat.man.ac.uk" target="_blank">http://goat.man.ac.uk</a>) 
        project builds on the work of GONG. The project is developing tools, which 
        allow users to extend the Gene Ontology as required by forming new compositional 
        concepts from smaller building blocks. We will demonstrate how these tools 
        may be used.<br>
