      welcome dinner is scheduled to commence at 7:00 pm Sunday evening, at the 
      Shere Khan restaurant, 52 Wilmslow, Rusholme. This restaurant is a straightforward 
      walk of about 35-45 minutes from the Ibis Hotel Manchester. Walk down Charles 
      Street to Oxford Road and turn left. After 10-15 minutes on Oxford you will 
      reach the University. Continue on Oxford until you walk through the entire 
      University grounds. At the other end of the University grounds, Oxford Road 
      turns into Wilmslow. The name of this part of town is Rusholme. The restaurant 
      is on this street. For more information about this restaurant, please visit 
      their web site at <a href="http://www.sherekhan.com/sherekhan.html" target="_blank">http://www.sherekhan.com/sherekhan.html</a></font></td>

        held at Lecture Theatre Room 1.1 (LT1.1) on the &quot;Lower First Floor&quot; 
        of the University of Manchester Computer Science Kilburn Building. This 
        building is situated on Oxford Road. A map of the location of the building 
        is:<br>

        If you walk to the Sunday welcome dinner (see above) you will walk right 
        by this building. It is about a 15 minute walk from the Ibis Hotel Manchester.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#006600" size="3">Now the computer science building is relatively 
        easy to find. Finding your way inside is much more difficult than you 
        would think though! (As a hint, if you stand on Oxford Road and look at 
        the building, any path or door that looks like it might go in is almost 
        certainly not the correct one. The only paths and doors that are worth 
        considering are those which are obviously wrong.) </font></p>
      <p><font color="#006600" size="3">Someone from the Stanford group will lead 
        a procession over to the workshop starting from the corner outside the 
        Ibis Hotel Manchester (corner of Princess &amp; Charles) at 8:00 am on 
        Monday. Please feel free to join us, whether or not you are staying at 
        this Ibis hotel.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#006600" size="3"> If you choose not to join 
        the procession I suggest you print out the photograph at <a href="entrance.jpg" target="_blank">http://protege.stanford.edu/workshop_vi/entrance.jpg</a><br>
        that shows how to get into the building. More extensive documentation, 
        including the above photo, about how to get to and into the building is 
        at: <a href="http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/mig/howtoget.html" target="_blank">http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/mig/howtoget.html</a><br>
        The Kilburn building (where you are going) is not actually in this photo 
        but is just off to the right. Although the photo may not seem terribly 
        clear now, when you are standing on Oxford road looking at the Kilburn 
        building and its surroundings and holding up a printout of the photo, 
        it will be a relatively straightforward matter to interpret the photo.</font><font size="3">
