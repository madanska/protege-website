		and Standard Terminology</span> (James R. Campbell, Samson W. Tu, Karen Hrabak, Mark A. Nyman, Julie Glasgow, 
		Robert McClure)<br /><br />
		This tutorial will discuss and demonstrate the SAGE guideline modeling process from beginning to end, starting with 
		a review of the Center for Disease Control (CDC) guideline for immunization practices, and ending with a runtime 
		demonstration of the clinical user view of immunization decision support. Participant interaction and discussion will 
		be encouraged and those interested may develop their own limited guideline model within the casework exercises provided 
		by the tutorial staff. A brief summary of issues related to interpretation of guidelines will be presented, followed by 
		examples of implementation scenario development, summarization of guideline logic creation, and an inventory of decision 
		concept requirements. Mapping and modeling of concepts with SNOMED CT, LOINC and other standard vocabularies will be 
		highlighted. The role of reference terminology features central to clinical decision support functions will be discussed. 
		Development of work context links and decision process modeling will be demonstrated using the Prot&eacute;g&eacute; guideline workbench. 
		Validation of the interoperable guideline model using Prot&eacute;g&eacute; extension plug-in features will be demonstrated. An execution 
		exemplar will be presented, illustrating the interaction of the SAGE guideline engine with the clinical information system 
		as seen by the clinical user.<br /><br />

	    <span class="bodyTextTitle"><a name="owl1" id="owl1"></a>OWL Tutorial I</span> (Alan Rector, Nick Drummond, Matthew Horridge, Hai Wang, 
	    Olivier Dameron)<br /><br />
	    OWL is the W3C standard ontology language for the Semantic Web, and 
	    <a href="../../overview/protege-owl.html">Prot&eacute;g&eacute;-OWL</a> the most widely used 
	    editing tool for OWL. This beginner's tutorial introduces OWL ontology development with Prot&eacute;g&eacute;-OWL and is 
	    the &quot;hands-on&quot; version of the 
	    <a href="http://www.co-ode.org/resources/tutorials/ProtegeOWLTutorial.pdf" target="_blank">Prot&eacute;g&eacute;-OWL pizza tutorial</a>. 
	    We will explain the basic language elements of OWL (classes, properties and individuals) and show how they can be 
	    edited with Prot&eacute;g&eacute;-OWL. We will then explore more complex OWL class descriptions by showing how different 
	    types of restrictions can be used to enhance the logical meaning of classes, after which we will discuss the important 
	    notion of primitive and defined classes. One of the key features of OWL is that it is underpinned by Description Logics, 
	    meaning that it has well understood formal semantics. This makes it possible to use a Description Logic reasoner as an 
	    aid in constructing an ontology, checking class consistency, and computing an inferred class hierarchy. Attendees will be 
	    exposed to this functionality throughout the tutorial, and we will provide a basic introduction to reasoning. More 
	    details on reasoning can be acquired in the &quot;Advanced Reasoning with OWL&quot; afternoon tutorial. We will also walk through selected other 
	    features of Prot&eacute;g&eacute;-OWL, including ontology visualization. Slides from related tutorials can be found 
	    on the <a href="http://www.co-ode.org/resources/tutorials/" target="_blank">CO-ODE Web site</a>.<br />

	    <span class="bodyTextTitle"><a name="owl2" id="owl2"></a>Advanced Reasoning with OWL</span> (Alan Rector, Nick Drummond, Matthew Horridge, Hai Wang, 
	    Olivier Dameron)<br /><br />
	    The goal of this tutorial is to leverage the reasoning capabilities of OWL. We will rely on the semantics of Description 
	    Logics to explain the principles of reasoning by classification. On this base, we will see how the expressivity of OWL 
	    constructs can be used (1) to represent knowledge, (2) to organize your concepts by classification, (3) to ensure that 
	    the ontology is correct, and (4) to make ontology maintenance easier. This tutorial is intended to be a complement to 
	    the basic Prot&eacute;g&eacute;-OWL tutorial. The session will mainly rely on hands-on exercises, so the practical 
	    aspect will be tackled. The overall message of this tutorial will definitely be about &quot;what to do?&quot; 
	    rather than about &quot;where to click?&quot;.<br />

	    <span class="bodyTextTitle"><a name="jamba" id="jamba"></a>Ontology Visualization with Jambalaya</span> (Chris Callendar)<br /><br />
	    <a href="http://www.thechiselgroup.org/jambalaya" target="_blank">Jambalaya</a> is a Prot&eacute;g&eacute; plug-in for 
	    visualizing ontologies. This tutorial will cover the basics of navigating 
	    ontologies: browsing concepts, filtering relationships and concepts, using layouts, and showing high level relationships. 
	    It will also cover querying ontologies and a quick overview of some of the new features in Jambalaya such as a degree of 
	    interest model and use of motion. The target audience for the tutorial are ontology users and developers. The focus will 
	    not be on Java programming, but any questions about extending Jambalaya are welcome after the tutorial.<br /><br />

	    <span class="bodyTextTitle"><a name="jess" id="jess"></a>JessTab Tutorial</span> (Henrik Eriksson)<br /><br />
	    This tutorial will introduce the <a href="http://www.ida.liu.se/~her/JessTab/" target="_blank">JessTab extension</a>, 
	    which enables the use of the <a href="http://herzberg.ca.sandia.gov/jess/" target="_blank">Java Expert System Shell (Jess)</a> 
	    under 
	    Prot&eacute;g&eacute;. The tutorial will cover basic Jess programming, rule-based reasoning with Jess under 
	    Prot&eacute;g&eacute;, and the use of Jess for managing Prot&eacute;g&eacute; ontologies and knowledge bases. 
	    Furthermore, the tutorial will address the mapping of instances in Prot&eacute;g&eacute; knowledge bases to Jess facts 
	    and use of the JessTab with both <a href="../../overview/protege-frames.html">Prot&eacute;g&eacute;-Frames</a> and 
	    <a href="../../overview/protege-owl.html">Prot&eacute;g&eacute;-OWL</a>. The tutorial will 
	    exemplify practical uses of Jess together with Prot&eacute;g&eacute; and discuss common design patterns. The tutorial 
	    will demonstrate how to install Jess and the JessTab and how to interact with the JessTab. The target audience is 
	    developers interested in combining ontologies and reasoning. No prior knowledge of Jess or the JessTab is required.<br />

	    <span class="bodyTextTitle"><a name="app_dev" id="app_dev"></a>Application Development with 
        Prot&eacute;g&eacute;</span> (Timothy Redmond, Tania Tudorache, Jennifer Vendetti)<br /><br />
	    This tutorial will address the issue of developing plug-ins and applications with Prot&eacute;g&eacute;. It will start with 
	    a description of the Prot&eacute;g&eacute; Plug-in Framework and describe how the plug-in framework can be used to 
	    add capabilities to the Prot&eacute;g&eacute; system. We will cover all of the 
	    <a href="../../doc/pdk/plugins/overview.html">existing plug-in types</a>. We will describe 
	    what is necessary to develop each type of plug-in and how each plug-in type extends the Prot&eacute;g&eacute; application. 
	    We will follow-up the discussion of Prot&eacute;g&eacute; plug-ins with a discussion of an alternative paradigm of 
	    development in Prot&eacute;g&eacute;: the development of standalone Prot&eacute;g&eacute; applications. We will see that in 
	    many cases, there is a natural evolution from the development of Prot&eacute;g&eacute; plug-ins to the development of 
	    standalone Prot&eacute;g&eacute; applications. We will describe the architectural design issues in application development 
	    and analyze some real deployed applications that have been built with Prot&eacute;g&eacute;. The target audience includes both 
	    Java programmers and non-programmers.<br /><br />

	      <span class="bodyTextTitle"><a name="visualization" id="visualization"></a>Ontology Visualization</span> 
	      (Jennifer Vendetti)<br /><br />
	      This tutorial will focus on several Prot&eacute;g&eacute; plug-ins that have been developed specifically for the 
	      purpose of visualizing ontologies. The first portion of the tutorial will be a hands-on walk-through of the graph 
	      widget tutorial that is <a href="../../doc/tutorial/graph_widget/index.html">available</a> on the Prot&eacute;g&eacute; 
	      Web site. The graph widget is a custom slot widget plug-in that allows users to graphically create and populate 
	      instances of classes. It is very useful as a) an alternative to 
	      <a href="http://protege.stanford.edu/doc/users_guide/forms/index.html" target="_blank">Prot&eacute;g&eacute; Forms</a> 
	      for entering instance data, b) as a way to visualize networks of instances, and c) as a way to visualize relationships 
	      between instances. The second portion of the tutorial will be a demonstration of the 
	      <a href="http://protege.cim3.net/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?OntoViz" target="_blank">Ontoviz</a> and 
	      <a href="http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/~ha/TGVizTab/TGVizTab.htm" target="_blank">TGViz</a> tab plug-ins. If time permits 
	      at the end of the tutorial, there will also be a demonstration of a new visualization plug-in called the 
	      <a href="http://protege.cim3.net/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?ImpactAlignmentTab" target="_blank">Impact &amp; Alignment Tab</a>, 
	      which is a work in progress and will be released in the fall.  The target audience for this tutorial are Prot&eacute;g&eacute; users 
	      with little exposure to the existing visualization plug-ins that are currently available.  If users plan to follow 
	      the hands-on portion of the tutorial, basic experience with navigating the Prot&eacute;g&eacute; user interface will be assumed. 
	      Attendees should know how to perform rudimentary tasks such as opening projects and creating new classes, slots, 
        and instances.
