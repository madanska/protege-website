	We invite proposals for workshops, to be held on the first day of the conference, July 23, 2006. All 
	workshops will be half-day events. The purpose of the workshops is to provide an informal setting 
	for participants to discuss technical issues and to exchange research ideas. We expect that most of 
	the workshops will be interactive events, centering on discussions rather than presentations. 
	
	We strongly advise having more than one organizer, bringing different perspectives to the workshop topic. We also 
	encourage submitters to contact us before the deadline if there is any concern about overlap with other similar 
	workshop topics. Workshop attendees must pay the conference registration fee.<br/><br/>
