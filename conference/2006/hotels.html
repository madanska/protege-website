	Register for the Prot&eacute;g&eacute; Conference</a> before making lodging reservations in order to take advantage 
	of our negotiated conference rates. -->
	
	Below please find local lodging establishments for which we have arranged  special conference rates and/or room blocks. Please be sure to check the information below and provide the necessary group identification information when making your reservation to ensure that you receive the discounted rate. Note, also that many of these special rates expire a month prior to the conference; be sure to make your reservations early to ensure receiving our discounted rates as well as procuring a room, which fill up fast during July. If you are eligible for other discounts (U.S. government, AAA, etc), you should check to see if these give you a better deal than our conference rate. That the rates indicated below do not include  local taxes (usually about 10%).  All of these lodgings are within 10 miles of the conference site and most provide free shuttle service - check with your place of lodging to confirm. We will be providing parking instructions via email to conference registrants who wish to drive to the conference. </p>
