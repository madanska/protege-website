"From Cottage Industry to the Industrial Age: New Infrastructure for Ontology Authoring and Dissemination"<br><br>

Mark Musen<br><br>

Just as the advent of desktop publishing made it possible for anyone with a computer to mass-produce beautiful typeset 
documents, the widespread availability of tools such as Prot&eacute;g&eacute; now makes it possible for large groups of individuals 
to mass-produce ontologies and electronic knowledge bases in a relatively informal manner. The ontologies and knowledge 
bases that these developers create, however, are not always particularly beautiful. Often, the pressure to represent badly 
needed content subverts the desire to adhere to good modeling practices and clear design principles. For ontology development 
to scale up to the demands of the industrial age, our community will require new research to support the creation and 
distribution of ontologies with the same kinds of techniques that guarantee the quality of our print media: Immediate access 
to new ontologies by interested users, immediate feedback to the developers, peer review by recognized experts, intelligent 
indexing and targeted retrieval of ontologies, and the creation of a culture that encourages widespread &quot;ontology 
criticism,&quot; in the same vein as literary criticism. We also will need a new generation of tools for development, 
dissemination, and  management of ontologies. The Prot&eacute;g&eacute; community certainly will play a major role in achieving this vision.
