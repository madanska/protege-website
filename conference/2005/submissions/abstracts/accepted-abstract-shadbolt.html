"Ontologies: Ancient and Modern"<br><br>

Nigel Shadbolt<br><br>

This talk will review the emergence of ontologies from a knowledge engineering tradition. It will describe the challenges 
associated with the attempts to model conceptual structures and how these have evolved and changed over time. It will discuss 
how the development of ontologies in Grid and Semantic Web contexts poses new challenges as well as presenting some perennial 
problems. The talk will be illustrated with a range of application experiences from over twenty-five years' involvement in 
applied artificial intelligence.
