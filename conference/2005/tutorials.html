		<li><span class="bodyTextTitle">Ontology development 101</span> (Natasha Noy)<br />
		This tutorial will address the basic issues of ontology design. We will discuss why one would want to build an ontology 
		and provide a general introduction to ontology development and conceptual modeling. We will describe a simple methodology 
		for ontology development, and will introduce basic components of ontologies such as classes, slots, and individuals. 
		We will discuss common problems and solutions in designing ontologies. We will present common modelling patterns for 
		representing n-ary relations, part-whole relations, and others. We will use Prot&eacute;g&eacute; to demonstrate the 
		process of ontology design in practice. The tutorial will include demonstrations of selected advanced features of 
		Prot&eacute;g&eacute;, such as editing knowledge-acquisition forms, using advanced widgets, modularizing projects by 
		using project inclusion, and others. The target audience for the tutorial are domain experts with little or no experience 
		in ontology design or Prot&eacute;g&eacute;.</li>

		<li><span class="bodyTextTitle">OWL Tutorial I</span> (Nick Drummond, Matthew Horridge, Holger Knublauch)<br />
		OWL is the W3C standard ontology language for the Semantic Web, and Prot&eacute;g&eacute;-OWL the most widely used 
		editing tool for OWL. This beginner's tutorial introduces OWL ontology development with Prot&eacute;g&eacute;. We will 
		explain the basic language elements of OWL (classes, properties and individuals) and show how they can be edited with 
		Prot&eacute;g&eacute;. We will then explore more complex OWL class descriptions by showing how different types of 
		restrictions can be used to enhance the logical meaning of classes, after which we will discuss the important notion 
		of primitive and defined classes. One of the key features of OWL is that it is underpinned by Description Logics, 
		meaning that it has well understood formal semantics. This makes it possible to use a Description Logic reasoner as 
		an aide in constructing an ontology, checking class consistency and computing an inferred class hierarchy. 
		Attendees will be exposed to this functionality throughout the tutorial, and we will provide a basic introduction to 
		reasoning. More details on reasoning can be acquired in the advanced afternoon tutorial. We will also walk through 
		selected other features of Prot&eacute;g&eacute;-OWL, including ontology visualization. Finally, we will illustrate how 
		OWL ontologies can be used to drive the development of Semantic Web applications. Slides from related tutorials can be 
		found at

		<li><a href="http://smi-web.stanford.edu/people/dameron/protegeConf2005/advancedReasoningOWL.html" target="_blank">
		<span class="bodyTextTitle">Advanced reasoning with OWL</span></a> (Olivier Dameron, Kaustubh Supekar)<br />
		The goal of this tutorial is to leverage the reasoning capabilities of OWL. We will rely on the semantics of 
		Description Logics to explain the principles of reasoning by classification. On this base, we will see how the 
		expressivity of OWL constructs can be used (1) to represent knowledge, (2) to organize your concepts by classification, 
		(3) to ensure that the ontology is correct, and (4) to make ontology maintenance easier. This tutorial is intended to 
		be a complement to the basic OWL Plugin tutorial. The session will mainly rely on hands-on exercices, so the practical 
		aspect will be tackled. However, the main message of this tutorial will definitely be about "what to do?" rather than 
		about "where to click?".</li>

		<li><span class="bodyTextTitle">Application development with Prot&eacute;g&eacute;</span> (Samson Tu, Ray Fergerson)<br />
		This tutorial is designed to answer the question: &quot;I built an ontology in Prot&eacute;g&eacute;, now how do I use it 
		in my application?&quot; It discusses architectural design issues in application development, walks through some of the 
		high-level tools (e.g., JessTab and Algernon) that are available, and analyzes some real, deployed applications that were 
		built using Prot&eacute;g&eacute;. The target audience of the tutorial includes managers and developers who need an 
		overview of the issues and approaches that are available for application development with Prot&eacute;g&eacute;. 
		The focus is not on code development.
		</li>

		<li><span class="bodyTextTitle">Prot&eacute;g&eacute; Plug-in Development</span> (Ray Fergerson)<br />
		This tutorial will focus on the ways that Prot&eacute;g&eacute; can be extended with plug-ins. We will cover all plug-in 
		types including the revised import/export plug-in types that became available in Prot&eacute;g&eacute; 3.1. The target 
		audience includes both Java programmers and non-programmers. Much of the tutorial will be about conceptual issues, 
		capabilities, limitations, and packaging. We will cover Java programming issues and code examples will be presented but 
		there will be little emphasis on the actual writing of Java code. No previous experience developing Prot&eacute;g&eacute; 
		extensions is assumed. Attendees should come away with a good idea of what can be done and how difficult it is to do it.</li>

		<li><span class="bodyTextTitle">Managing ontology life-cycle in Prot&eacute;g&eacute;</span> (Samson Tu, Jennifer Vendetti)<br />
		The basic Prot&eacute;g&eacute; interface allows users to create, view, and edit ontologies and knowledge bases. In the life 
		cycle of ontology development, a user faces additional tasks, such as importing existing resources, visualizing and querying 
		ontologies, checking integrity constraints, comparing versions, managing multiple related ontologies for multiple users, and 
		exporting knowledge content. In this tutorial, we will examine how the Prot&eacute;g&eacute; plug-in architecture facilitates 
		extensions of Prot&eacute;g&eacute;’s core functionality to support these tasks. We will first review the different types of 
		Prot&eacute;g&eacute; plug-ins, then discuss and demonstrate options available for the various tasks in ontology life-cycle 
		and application development. The tutorial assumes some basic familiarity with Prot&eacute;g&eacute; and is designed to help 
		beginning and intermediate users exploit available tools to get their work done.</li>
