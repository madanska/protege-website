          With more than 200,000 registered users, Protégé is by far the most 
          widely used ontology editing environment in the world. The Protégé 
          Short Course offers a 3-day intensive training in use of the Protégé 
          toolset, ontology development, and OWL.
        </p>
        <p>
          We cover best practices in ontology building and the latest Semantic Web 
          technologies, including OWL 2, RDF, SPARQL, and SWRL. The course includes 
          lots of hands-on activities and we allow plenty of time for interaction 
          with the instructors.  We allocate time daily for you to work on your own 
          projects, and to ask the Protégé team for advice and feedback. All instructors 
          are Protégé staff members, so you will learn directly from the creators of the 
          toolset.
        </p>
        <h3 class="heading-c upcase">Who Should Attend</h3>
