      <p>The goal of this hands-on exercise is to try your hand in agile collaborative ontology development.</p>
      
      <p>Imagine that you are developing an ontology to represent information about a media publishing company. We will assign you to one of the following teams:</p>
      
      <p>
        <b>Team 1: Newspaper "Semantic Web News"</b>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <b>Team 2: Magazine "Semantics Weekly"</b>
      </p>
      <p>Each of the publishing companies has four departments:</p>
      
      <ol>
        <li>The <b><a href="#Content_department" title=""> Content department</a></b> 
          is responsible for the actual newsworthy content of the periodical. You need 
          to represent the information pertaining to articles, their authors, topics, 
          content, etc.
        </li>
        <li>The <b><a href="#Advertising_department" title=""> Advertising department</a></b> 
          handles the content and placement of advertisement. You need to represent content 
          about advertisers, who from your department is responsible for each client, the 
          prices they pay for their ads and other conditions, the article topics where they 
          want their ads to appear, and so on.
        </li>
        <li>The <b><a href="#Human_Resources_department" title=""> Human Resources department</a></b> 
          is responsible for all the personnel issues. You will model the different types of employees 
          (some of whom are authors of the articles, some work in the advertising department).
        </li>
        <li> The <b><a href="#Digital_content_department" title=""> Digital content department </a></b> 
          is responsible for both the regular content in the digital format as well as web site specific 
          content, such as multi-media content, digital subscriptions, and so on.
        </li>
      </ol><br />

<a name="Content_department" id="Content_department"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">2.1 Content department </span></h3>
<p>The <b>Content department</b> is responsible for the actual newsworthy content of the periodical. You need to represent the information pertaining to articles, their authors, topics, content, etc.
</p>
<ul><li> Model different types of articles and their properties:
<ul><li> Articles:
<ul><li>title, author, date published, edited by, keywords/topics, published in section, media (pictures, video), external links etc.
</li></ul>
</li><li> Content structure:
<ul><li> Date published, issue, front matter etc.
</li><li> Sections: Domestic News, World News, Editorial, Magazine, Letters, Commentary, Television Listings, Advertisements, Appointments/Jobs, Sport, Business etc.
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Competency questions that the data in your ontology should be able to address:
<ul><li> What are the articles in the July 9th issue?
</li><li> What are the articles that a particular journalist wrote?
</li><li> What are the typical sections in the paper/magazine?
</li><li> Who is the editor responsible for all the news articles? 
</li><li> What front matters are about what topics in 2012 issues?
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p><br />

<br />
<a name="Advertising_department" id="Advertising_department"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">2.2 Advertising department </span></h3>
<p>The <b>Advertising department</b> handles the content and placement of advertisement. You need to represent content about advertisers, who from your department is responsible for each client, the prices they pay for their ads and other conditions, the article topics where they want their ads to appear, and so on.
</p>
<ul><li> Model different types of advertisements and their properties:
<ul><li> Advertisements:
<ul><li> Types of advertisements: company ads, personal ads and classifieds, topics of ads, etc.
</li></ul>
</li><li> Properties:
<ul><li> Cost of advertisements, payment plans
</li><li> The section where the company ads should appear, etc.
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Competency questions that the data in your ontology should be able to address:
<ul><li> Which advertisements should go in the travel section (mobile apps section)?
</li><li> How much do the ads in this issue cost? Are ads in some sections more expensive than in others?
</li><li> Who is the employee responsible for dealing with a particular company client?
</li><li> Who is the main contact person for ad buyers?
</li><li> What company ads appeared in what sections of what issues?
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<br />

<br />
<a name="Human_Resources_department" id="Human_Resources_department"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">2.3 Human Resources department </span></h3>
<p>The <b>Human Resources department</b> is responsible for all the personnel issues. You will model the different types of employees (some of whom are authors of the articles, some work in the advertising department).
</p>
<ul><li> Employees:  
<ul><li> Columnist, Editor, Section Editor, Reporter, International Reporter, Manager
</li></ul>
</li><li> Properties:
<ul><li> name, contact details: email, phone number, role
</li><li> Articles that the author wrote, sections that editors are responsible for, etc.
</li><li> Supervisors and those they supervise.
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Competency questions that the data in your ontology should be able to address:
<ul><li> Who supervises all the news editors?
</li><li> What is the email of the author of the front page article in today's issue?
</li><li> Who are all the managers?
</li><li> Who was the editor of an issue that contains an article about gun control close to a gun construction company ad?
</li></ul>
</li></ul>

<br />

<hr />

<br />
<a name="Digital_content_department" id="Digital_content_department"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">2.4 Digital content department </span></h3>
<p>The <b>Digital content department</b> is responsible for both the regular content in the digital format as well as web site specific content, such as multi-media content, digital subscriptions, and so on. You will need to model different types of digital content, subscription information, access controls (e.g., certain subscribers get premium content)
</p>
<ul><li> Model different types of information related to digital content:
<ul><li> Web site content:
<ul><li>link to the content in the paper itself, type of content, who can access it (e.g., premium content), advertisement
</li></ul>
</li><li> Subscription:
<ul><li>users, types of subscription, payments, access privileges, browsing history, interests, suggestions.
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Competency questions that the data in your ontology should be able to address:
<ul><li> Is there a user with specific email?
</li><li> Can a user access a specific article?
</li><li> Is there multi-media content--and of what type--associated with this article? Is this content available to everyone or only to subscribers?
</li><li>  What are the articles that a particular user might be interested in (e.g., their topics correspond to the user's interests)
</li><li> How much revenue have the subscriptions brought in during 2012?
</li><li> Who is responsible for advertising on the web site?
</li><li> Which ads should we display next to a specific article?
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p><br />
</p>

<hr />

<p>All four departments will be developing a single ontology for their publication. Each department will mostly work in their own branch but there will obviously be overlap and cross-references. You can use the collaborative features of the tool to negotiate or you can walk across the room to strategize together.
</p><p>You have approximately 30 minutes for this stage of the exercise. We will tell you what the second stage is after you are done.
