        <h1>WebProt&eacute;g&eacute; Exercise - Part 2</h1>
    
    <p>
	<b>News flash</b>: There has been a lot of consolidation in the publishing industry! The "Semantic Web News" newspaper has bought the "Semantics Weekly". The new large companies will keep their ontologies that describe all their data but are now hard at work to incorporate the data from the periodicals that they acquired.
	</p>
	
	<p>
If you were part of the "bought out" team, your ontology will need to be retired. Your task now is to make sure that all the important distinction are represented in some way in the ontology of the new owners.
</p>

<p>
Look at the ontology of the new owners, specifically considering the department that you were responsible for. For example, if you were developing an ontology for the content of "Semantics Weekly", look at the concepts related to the content of the "Semantic Web News", and consider the following questions:

<ul>
   <li> Did you take different modeling approaches? Why did each team chose to do what they did? </li>
   <li> Which approach is better? Why? </li>
   <li>  You don't have a choice but to take the new owner's ontology as the core? Can this ontology accommodate the distinction that you have made in the other ontology?</li>
   <li>  How can you change it that the ontologies become more aligned?</li>
   <li> What do you think about each other's design choices?</li>
   <li> If you knew from the beginning that you would need to integrate, could you have designed your ontology differently? How?</li>
</ul>
</p>
