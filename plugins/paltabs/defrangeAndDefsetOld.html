<p>So what's the syntax for defrange ? There are actually 5 distinct types defrange
statements. They all have the form </p>

<p>(defrange [variable] [type] [type-specific information]) </p>

<p>[variable] is simply a local or global variable name. [type] is one of SET,FRAME,
INTEGER, STRING, SYMBOL, NUMBER and {refinement} depends on the type </p>

<p>There are two possible defranges using SET as a value for [type] </p>

<p>(defrange variable SET [setname]) (defrange variable SET [setname] [slotname]) </p>

<p>That is, you must specify the set the variable is ranging over. And, optionally, you
can specify a slot. The meaning of the second form is &quot;all elements of this set which
are values for the specified slot&quot; </p>

<p>FRAME is exactly parallel to SET (not surprising, since &quot;class&quot; is really
just a strange way of spelling &quot;set&quot;). </p>

<p>(defrange variable FRAME [classname]) (defrange variable FRAME [classname])[slotname]) </p>

<p>The first is simply &quot;instances of the named class&quot; and the second is
&quot;instances of the named class which are values of the specified slot. </p>

<p>The final 4 types require a slot (because the implied binding spaces would otherwise be
infinite). So, for example. </p>

<p>(defrange variable INTEGER [slotname]) </p>

<p>This means &quot;all integers which are values of that slot.&quot; Which is marginally
cool in a reifed-slots sort of way. For example </p>

<p>(defrange %height INTEGER height) (forall %height (&gt; %height 0)) </p>

<p>constrains the integer values of the slot height wherever it happens to be attached.
All future users of this slot, in either the current kb, or in any kb that includes it,
are constrained ! -------------- </p>

<p>-------------- A discussion of defrange leads immediately to a discussion of defset.
The immediate question is, of course, &quot;What's a set ?&quot; </p>

<p>The answer is that a set is simply an enumerated list of things. You use one of the
following forms for defset </p>

<p>(defset [setname] FRAME [list of frame names]) (defset [setname] INTEGER [list of
integers]) (defset [setname] STRING [list of strings]) (defset [setname] SYMBOL [list of
symbols]) (defset [setname] NUMBER [list of numbers]) </p>

<p>And then you can have variables range over the set. </p>

<p>element-of is a two-place predicate involving a term and a set. It is of the form </p>

<p>(element-of [term] [set]) </p>

<p>And the only real use case is when the term is either a variable or a function
involving a variable. So, for example, you might write the following constraint </p>

<p>(defset Swedish-Male-First-Names STRING Lars Erik Bjorn) (defrange ?person FRAME
Person) </p>

<p>(forall ?person (=&gt; (and (= (country ?person) Sweden) (sex ?person
&quot;male&quot;)) (element-of (first-name ?person) Swedish-First-Names) ) </p>

<p>(roughly &quot;All swedish men have a first name of either Lars, Erik or Bjorn&quot;)
-------------- </p>

<p>-------------- The way to think about defset is that it gives you the ability to make
arbitrary &quot;and no more&quot; statements about your ontology. So, for example,
borrowing an example from Austin's most incomprehensible ontology </p>

<p>(defset BaseClasses IntangibleThing PartiallyIntangibleThing PartiallyTangibleThing
TangibleThing) (defrange ?baseClass SET BaseClasses) (defrange ?baseClass2 SET
BaseClasses) (defrange ?frame FRAME THING) </p>

<p>(forall ?frame (or (exists ?baseClass (instance-of ?frame ?baseClass)) (= ?frame THING)
) ) (forall ?frame (exists ?baseClass (exists ?baseClass2 (=&gt; (and (instance-of ?frame
?baseClass) (instance-of ?frame ?baseClass2) ) (= ?baseClass ?baseClass2) ) ) </p>

<p>What this states, in an intensional way, is that the BaseClasses are almost a complete
partition of the knowledge base-- everything (except for THING) is an instance of exactly
one of them.</p>
