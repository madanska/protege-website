<p>Notes on Evaluation Strategy</p>

<hr>

<p>Points to make:</p>

<p>Evaluation is lazy</p>

<p>Evaluation is entire -- domain of predicate is entire universe</p>

<p>Inappropriate arguments are simply false</p>

<p>There is no such thing as a list. Iteration is a procedural concept which maps to
either forall or exists</p>
