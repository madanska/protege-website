<img src="images/header_line.gif" width="590" height="6"></h1></div><p>PAL allows a user to add logical queries to a knowledge base,
beyond the <a href="http://protege.stanford.edu/doc/tutorial/getting_started/create_query.html"><font color="#000000">built-in
querying facility</font></a> of Protégé-2000. For example, in the <em>newspaper</em>
sample project, you might want to find all the employees who form a team; that
is, employees whose responsible editor is responsible for more than one employee
(i.e., this query might translate to finding all the instances of the class <em>Employee</em> that are values for
the slot <em>responsible_for</em> of an instance of the class <em>Editor </em>which
has more than 1 value for its <em>responsible_for</em> slot).</p>
<p align="left">The syntax for PAL queries is very similar to the one for PAL constraints. PAL supports writing arbitrary queries about the contents of a
knowledge base. PAL queries are modeled with <a href="lang_framework.htm">special-purpose
frames</a> and thus also can be saved as part of the knowledge base. PAL queries
can be executed with the <a href="query_tab.htm">PAL querying engine</a>.</p>
