<img src="images/header_line.gif" width="590" height="6"></h1></div><p>You can evaluate constraints using the <a href="constraints_tab.htm"> PAL
Constraints Tab</a>. The PAL engine will check that the instances in the
knowledge base conform to your constraints and the <a href="constraints_tab.htm"> PAL
Constraints Tab</a> will display any instances that violate
them.</p>
<p>To evaluate constraints:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Go to the <a href="constraints_tab.htm"> PAL Constraints Tab</a> and make sure
    the constraint(s) you want to evaluate are displayed. See <a href="disp_const_const.htm">Displaying Constraints at the Constraints Tab</a>
    for more information.</li>
  <li>Tag the constraints you want to evaluate by clicking in the <b>Evaluate?</b>
    column. Tag constraints are shown with a check <img border="0" src="images/check.gif" width="16" height="15">.</li>
  <li>Click the <b>Evaluate indicated constraints</b> button.<br>
    The PAL engine evaluates the instances of each tagged constraint. Constraints
    that are not violated are marked with a green checkmark; constraints which
    are violated by some instance are marked with a red warning.</li>
  <li>To see details about a particular constraint, click on the constraint to
    select it.&nbsp;<br>
    The area at the right of the PAL Constraints Tab displays the instances which
    violate the constraints grouping them by the name of the variable that they
    fill in one violated occurrence of the constraint. In some cases, for clarity, you might want to declare a variable
    which is otherwise unused so that the specific instances that fill that
    variable on violation will appear when the constraint is
    evaluated.</li>
</ol>
<p>For example, in this report for the editor-employees-salary-constraint in the
newspaper example, the following violating instances are displayed:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/eval_c2.gif" width="453" height="81"></p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p>We see that in one instance, Joe Schmo earns more than his editor Mr.
Science. Similarly, Larry Tennis-nut makes more than Sports Nut.</p>
<p>You can view the Instance Form for any of the displayed instances by clicking
on the instance to highlight it and then clicking the View <img border="0" src="images/View.gif" width="15" height="15">
button at the upper right of the pane.</p>
